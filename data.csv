0,Rahul T,Overall I'll call it value for money although it has several limitations,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It consumes around 10gb of storage in 24hours in 'HD' mode.Pros :Night mode recording.Clarity of camera.Multiple users can watch camera recording at same time.Two way communication.1080p HD recording.Can record videos without internet , requires internet connection after switching camera on - after that you can disconnect & recording will continue.ICons:It doesn't support AUTO 360° rotation. User has to manually adjust camera from application.If there is a power outage or by any chance you disconnect power source , camera would start recording again after you connect it to internet.You need to keep camera connected to a power source for 24hours - charging option would've been helpful here.Application sometimes sends motion alerts after delay of 30minutes(approx).Memory card of storage capacity greater than 64gb are not supported."
1,Sukdeb Das,cannot connect the device,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I cannot connect the device with my Jiofi  so please help me out
2,Amazon Customer,Under 3K best ip cam from Mi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1) Simple install (only first time you need to configure with camera + router through Mi Home app, after that if you power off your router or camera and it will automatically reconnect when these are switch it on)2) 1080p HD cam(view full frame also, without moving the camera angle you can see the full frame view)3) You can monitor from remote end (need good internet both in router and mobile, otherwise start buffering)4) two way talk5) share your camera to your family member( both are should be in same server)6) good look( only one colour- white)7) value of money8) support upto 64 GB micro sd card9) Record video without internet also (some of the amazon customer commented that it will not work without internet. It is totally a false statement)Cons:Nothing"
3,Pothi Kalimuthu,"Other than initial hiccups, some (Mi Home app) software bugs, it is good for monitoring!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Remember... nothing is perfect. Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What's more! You get ads in the app right after opening it (on the dashboard where you see the list of devices) since version 5.4.43 (released on Dec 26, 2018). I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isn't compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi (not released in India) are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup (with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to / from the camera), you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you don't want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!"
4,Krish B,Installation Issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Any future buyer.. this product may be a good one for lucky ones only... My experience is1. Inadequate information about network connectivity... You won't be able to connect to wifi if it is higher than 2.4 Ghz. You will come to know only when you try to configure it for the first time :(2. You are really lucky if this camera can read QR code in your phone during setup. I spend a whole day and no luck. Then , after google, I realised that this is a known issue. Even you would found this issue reported by another customer, here3. Its not directly sold by MI. A retailer who's phone given by Amazon customer support is found always switched off4. So as I couldn't even complete initial setup using high-speed cable broadband or using Airtel Dongle. I can't comment about how good or bad its rest features..."

6,Vibu Poongode,No cloud storage,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Unfortunately no cloud storage service...so I returned it.... Product is only for indoor use...
7,Damanjit Singh Minhas,Defective product and got it replaced at MI service centre,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Was Unable to connect and use the camera. Finally went to the MI service centre and got a replacement at no additional cost. Finally it's working and operational now .....
8,Amazon Customer,"not of much use, if not having wifi and outdoor installation",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. this product is of not much use if you don't have 24 hrs good wifi.2. 64 gb data card store recording of 6 days. when the video quality was at low level.3. recording are of 1 minute each. that is 60 files in 1 hr. no options available.4. not a waterproof5. you cannot connect a usb cable or any other cable to watch the recording6. if you have connected to a camera using wifi system A, then if you want to change yoir wifi to B, you have to reset the camera. means you cannot use more than 1 wifi, especially when it is installed at some height.7. no battery or power backup. if there would have been option of 5 minute, then it would have been good option.8. mi home app is not for pc or laptop.9. mi home app screen doesn't rotate.it seems to be a good option if it is inside room, good wifi 24 hrs and person watches not so frequently.10. consumes around 1gb data per day if someone watching it like a regule cctv camera full day, at low quality settings. just an estimate, not confirmed.11. no setting in mi home app to transfer file from sd card to your mobile.it seems to be so good but it lacks lot of things.12. nice beautiful piece.13. can be rotated easily in all directions through app.14. if someone steals the camera, then you  lost all the recordings and the memory sd card along with it.15. no cloud storage, i didn't find.16. you have to purchase memory card also. and if someone can reach the camera, memory card can be stolen easily and hence all records17. it has facility of NAS, but then you have to purchase nas device.18. net price = camera price + microsd card + internet charges + nas charges (if purchasing)."
9,CHAITHANYA GOUD DONTHI,Video quality not so good.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  BUT, quality of product is good. And setup is easy."
10,Mahendra P. Singh,Amazing Mi 360° home cam,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Wifi 360° home cam is really amazing, I am using this device from 5-6 days. Two way talking is good, night-vision is good, picture quality is good, auto rotation feature is also very good, but your need high speed internet to get high quality picture with camera rotation feature to use it's features.I monitor or even move camera, when I am outside home or in office. One can also monitor kids and give instructions to them.It uses only 16 to 64 GB Class 10 memory card for storage. I use 'only record when motion detected' and after 5 days my 32 GB memory card full. It's also record even like e. g. curtain moving or even light blinks.I already attach 360°camera and wifi with inverter point, so my camera works online smoothly, even if power goes off sometimes.Suggestions for improvement in Mi Camera:Internal memory space should be given upto 256 GB to record videos up to 4-5 weeks.Other colors option should also be provide like black, etc. White colors easily catch dust and you have clean the same within short-intervals.I just buy another one arnd 14th Aug, 2019 as per performance of 1st cam. Really good one, but internal storage should be provide of min 128 GB."
11,abhishek mazumder,This is amazing product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My Dad is 86 yrs old and staying home alone while we are at work..I have installed the device to keep an watch that he is safe at home and to be connected all the time.He cant use phone ......till date connected with him while we are out side is a challenge as most of the time he cannot even received the call as he was confused to use phone ..now after installed this device, I feel  its actually a peace of mind....can talk to him any given point of time he can easily asked for anything at any time and most importantly he is allays in front of my eyes.Thanks to MI for such a lovely /economic/essay-go/Quality product"
12,sachin,As per description,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Very good product.Immediate connect.No hassle.Very smooth functioning and silentCan't zoom inAnd requires good connectivity
13,RP,Useless after power cut.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Picture quality is good. Very east to setup and install and easy to use.Disadvantage is, It will not work without WIFI and another problem I found after using 3 month is, It's stop working after power cut. You have to restart device which make product use less. You can not check remotely if power went down. Also it's work only on mobile. Can't use on PC. Difficult to get recording."
14,Brahmaji sha,You can see your rooms from anywhere in the world.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros+ Works with wifi.+ Full had a picture+ You can watch and hear your home under the purview of your cc camEasy installatiin+Even small insects movements can watch through your android mobile.+ We can speak through the app to the camera. Camera has a speaker.Cons-Motion detection ring sound must include in the app.Continuous wifi and power is not possible all times. If thief cut the power cable or wifi network connection then Camera will not work.
15,Charan kohli ,Beauty with brain.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best IP camera that I have ever used.The looks, quality and performance is a level ahead.The best things is the MI app which is really very responsive and user friendly.This records 1080p quality which is quite good for indoor use weather for office or at home. The camera has an inverted picture option if you want to hang on ceiling.The camera automatically connects back to wifi if ever power cut.You can also store the video files saved on micro sd to other computer or laptop through wifi so in case of theft or data loss you have a back up available. Motion detection sends you notification over phone app In case any movement find.Initially I was using D3D cam with which I had a horrible experience in term of quality and service backup.After using it for few days in office, I re order one for my home.Guys if you planning to buy go for it without wasting any time.You will never regret on your decision.One last thing which I find minus in this product it don’t auto rotate, one has to rotate through app to see live feeds which I notice no other company is offering in this budget.My big thumps up to MI for making this beautiful product at really affordable cost."
16,Ganesh,Worth it... No more worried,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Best in the industry for such price point .. 1080p .. very easy configuring the cam .. lovely piece of hardware ..
17,Gagan,Best Camera for home monitoring,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this camera for a month now and here are my observations. The build quality is very good as always with mi. I am using 4GB memory card for recording and it records about 14-15 hrs which is more than enough for me. There is a small slot below the lens for memory card and no it does not come with memory card, that you need to buy yourself. The app mi home app is easy to install and use. moves 360 degree. You can even use calling function on the app to talk to other person in front of camera. Voice quality is decent. It even has a monitoring feature wherein you get an alert if there is any moment. Plus, video is recorded with voice on memory card. Image quality is excellent with night vision. Overall good buy for people who want to keep an eye on kids or old ones who need monitoring. Solves the purpose very well. Will surely buy second one."
18,surya kuchibotla,simply superb- easy to install and packed with features,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  i have tried  different wifi cameras earlier , but mi is so far the best in quality and performance .clarity is amazing and  few clicks to install.must buy for home"
19,ELEMENT,"Not Good, Not Bad",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Main problem is connectivity, not play live feed smoothly even when  both side broadband speed is 20 mbps, picture quality is good on HD, Night vision is awesome, motion detection is working wellMi have to add 1 feature in camera is that when internet is not working , recording should continue in SD card, Currently if your internet connection  lost then your camera doesn't record the footage"
20,Brajesh kumar,Filthy chinease Product,1.0 out of 5 stars,  After one month of use the camera is getting offline inspite of continue power supply and internet supply.Need to unplug then plug in the device. If you are planning to install it and thinking to go for tour then it's very bad idea.
21,Dr Raghu Ram,Excellent deal for the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was just looking to make my workplace CCTV equipped when I came across this. I am not a major user of the cam and this served my purpose really well. Can see what's happening at my workplace from anywhere. I am still figuring out how to get a NAS storage. Once that's done, I think this would be great. Image quality is excellent even in the dark. Ability to talk both ways and ability to pan it 360 degrees makes it an excellent purchase."
22,Ravi,Excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  No DVr ,complicating wires it's as simple as charging a phone ,gives you access to view on multiple tablets mobile site etc whatever you are comfortable with ,just needs wifi ,even if you don't watch data will store on cloud for 7 days ,so even if somebody damages or steals your camera you can go and see on cloud who did that act ,option of micro sd card is there for storage on local device itself but I don't need that"
23,Joe,"The Camera is Good, but the Software (in Xiaomi /MI Home app) is Terrible",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is regarding the HOME SURVEILLANCE ASSISTANT feature inside the app:#1) The 10 seconds for video recording is too short. So the purpose of purchasing the camera is not fulfilled, making the device is useless.Xiaomi should give us an option to extend the recording time limit to at least 2 minutes.#2) The minimum ""Alarm Interval"" is 3 minutes, which is too long. Xiaomi should also give an option to reduce it to 1 minute.Reason for the feedback: I suffered property damage, and the perpetrator could not be identified even after installing the Camera"
24,Hriddhiman Mukherjee,Exceeds Expectations ( After 4 Months Of Extensive Use),4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a no brainer when it comes to the sheer Value For Money factor the product offersI am writing is after 4 Months of Regular & Extensive Use.Let's talk about the good things first:1. The product is very well made & built to last2. The power adaptor cord is long enough and can reach upto fairly good height.3.Regular Micro USB cable so a big advantage even if it goes broke in future you can replace it without any issue.4. WiFi Connectivity, Connection Esthablishedment Time is excellent ( depends on your connection speed obviously)5. Motion Detection works flawlessly, notification for motion detection works like a charm.CAMERA Quality:Steams at 1080P and if your connection is strong you won't be disappointed infact will be surprised to see the quality it offers.Low light visibility is decent but where it excels is Night Vision which works excellently for the price it comes at.The 360 deg. viewing is very good and controlling it via the mobile app is a hassle free experience.Audio quality is decent. It picks up the voices clearly but don't expect it to work like a telephone.The Digital Zoom works good. Slightly distortion can be observed when maxed out but is not a deal breaker.I have installed the Mi Home App on both my Android & Apple Device and on both the app works very good. The UI is decent and gets the work done easily. Sometimes with poor connections there's a bit of buffering issue but that again is connection dependent.Setting up the device is very easy, the voice commands guide your through the entire process and you won't find any difficulty in setting up.Once set up successfully you will hardly have any problem of connection loss , WiFi loss or issues like that. Open the app & it's working flawlessly.Obviously make sure to have a good internet connection.Cons:For the price the product comes there are very few , even if it has its like nit picking.A conventional Security Cam will cost around 5K at least if I am not worng. Set up is a hassle.You get this product for half the price, setting it up is very easy and works like charm. I am kind of a tech geek and with whatever knowledge I have this product is definitely worth every penny.So if you are looking for a security cam at a affordable price that gets the job done, then this product will meet your expectations and even exceed.I have a strong internet connection & till now I have never faced any issue. It works very good and for the price it comes at it gets the job done atleast for me."
25,A K Shetty,"Superb camera for the price, can connect with Jiofi hotspot",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is best security camera for the price. Basically price is peanuts for its features and quality. The video quality is great, audio quality is good but not best. Has loads of features, can do remote monitoring from anywhere in the world and also has two way talking feature.While configuring you need wifi of 2.4GHz only. Home wifi router is best because of faster internet. It also works well with Jiofi hotspot. While configuring mi home app with Jiofi select country as India (Asia server) and not India (Recommended) or else it won't connect. Regular wifi connection is straight forward.You can add more devices with single app, it has motion detection, night vision is decent, you can also share device with others, also password protect the device.The only cons of this camera is that it's best for horizontal mounts either on ceiling or flat surface. For vertical wall mounts the up and down camera movement is bit limited. However if mounted at high position it can be more flexible."
26,Alex R.,not great,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  i used Mi phone(note 4) for initial setup....i did not know that camera and phone should be on the same wiFi network....so i struggled to configure. Later i configured it once or twice successfully.Once my phone is away from WiFi, i loose the video and also when i reconnect it is not detecting the old setup.I bought this camera to monitor my home when i am out...but since this camera do not work on two networks...i am returning this.But i should agree, video  quality was good."
27,Amazon Customer,Worst customer service....sorry no customer service n bad cam,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera stopped working 3 months back n its still in warranty but no one to help.Tried contacting costumer service..no one answers...it goes round n round in ivr.N there are no help videos online.People who are planning to buy it...its risk n waste of money.
28,ar.ramkrish,"Excellent security cam, feature rich at great price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the best security cam at great price. Excellent quality, feature rich, easy to setup, controllable from anywhere, can rotate 360 degree or tilt up and down, live view, supports SD card memory upto 128 GB, android application Mi Home adds huge value and ease of use, generates QR code...camera just see it and does the pairing automatically. Image quality is great, night vision works even in complete darkness, low light vision is excellent with color as well. Overall the best security capable of streaming and remote controllable camera!"
29,Amazon Customer,A must buy for your home security.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A great product .. must buy for home .. cheapest and the best option.. the whole video quality and buffer capacity depends on your wifi speed. Tecords live video into the storage card also. Two way talk feature is amazing and also the motion detector. I am waiting for this to be available again.. this is also very easy to install.
30,Shirish Kulkarni,Go for it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received in one day! Thanks to Amazon!Picture quality is amazing. Can hear what is going on at my home live. Talk back audio is sufficiently loud to warn invader. So easy to set up. QR code scanning happened in just 2 mins. Tip from my side is, just hold the phone 15 cm from camera keep it steady when the camera says scanning for qr code.. and its done.Hats off to mi for such a user friendly device."
31,manish,A descent MI product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is a wonderful PTZ HD camera with good clarity. With same feature other brands are much costly.I had to buy Samsung EVO Plus Grade 3, Class 10 64GB micro SD card costing 999/-. This card works perfectly with camera. Using from 2 months and satisfied with the performance. It need high internet speed at both end.Once configured, it starts recording in card, internet wifi is needed only if you want to watch remotely.Mi should allow the access of camera from windows also."
32,Raunaq Roy,good hardware but software sucks and is intrusive,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The hardware is great for the price. The software, as in the case of MI phones is a big sucker. they always overdo the software part. It was better if they had just released the sdk and let people develop it for free as opensource.  Also note, the software sends device data to MI server at regular intervals, so if you have any issue with that beware of this and don't buy.  One problem I read in other reviews too is the camera stops rotating, this is software glitch, it cannot negotiate multiple/unsend message/replies from either app/MI server or device,  needed to either recalibrate or restart the device#Not having a web interface or rest api is a major negative for this device, adds a lot to privacy woes, as it appears the MI not willing to let you use the device without collecting your data from app."
33,Amazon Customer,Overall Nice product for home and office use,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hello All, its good product for home and office security,  its function is totally depend on your wifi speed and bandwidth, overall i can give 4 start :Drawback after using a month :1 I can see is 32 GM card can save up to 4-5 days data only, MI need to work on this.2 This camera will not be accessible without WIFI, (if wifi shut down then you can not access this camera ) MI need to work on this, it should be accessible as a wifi device to connect our mobile with this camera without wifi so that if there is no wifi then we can connect our mobile with this camera to see the live recordings.3 Its not weather proof as well, you cant put this camera outside your premises (office or home)This is what i observe in one month of usage.thanksDhiraj Ghai"
34,Vishal Jadhav,All good except one problem,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good:- Clear night vision.- Easy to setup. Got it ready in two minutes.- Recorded videos take up less space. 16 GB can store up to two days of recording.- Two way calling is really handy feature.Bad:- Although it records detected motions right away, sometimes it takes hours to get the notification on phone. That kind of defeats the purpose."
35,Sumit Gupta,"Easy to set up, good quality, excellent 0lux capability",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This was a breeze to set up. Detected via Mi Home app easily and configured. The night vision is amazing... very crisp greyscale video in pitch darkness (it has IR illuminators which can’t be seen unlike the red dots in cheap cameras). There is IR cut as well, for daylight, which provides better quality images. The mechanism for PTZ is silent and smooth and coverage is excellent."
36,BiPS,REVIEW AFTER 1YEAR must read,5.0 out of 5 stars,  After its warranty gets over out starts showing many errors. Now after 8months it is not able to scan QR code which is important to pair. And thus can't be repaired only replaced in service center of any defect comes within warranty. Now it is only eligible to go to dustbin 😔😔😔My old review :-Very great product. Very easy 2 install. Just u need is an active internet connection and a memory card. Then u can see Ur home from any corner of the world and also frighten the thieves by the voice feature and also listen what they speak. TRULY TERRIFIC. but Xiaomi is now not keeping this in stock🤪
37,tej,Waste of money does not work offline,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It does not work offline , waste of money more over u cant return it only replace .How silly even by putting a memory card inside it it needs a wifi connection to work"
38,Deepak kumar,Good Product with lots of CONS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi,First of all it's Nice product, But Don't think its a perfect product. I can understand that MI did good work but still there are many holes which they have to coverPros1) Night Vision is Ok Camera recording quality is good2) good choice for Home use onlycons1) Its white color, you need to give extra care, It start looking dusty soon2) There is no option to control this device locally you need internet connection to maintain this through MI Home Application ( if any options please correct me)3) MI didn't provide cloud storage with this product (were you serious before launching this product Team MI ? you need to give some space on cloud, only providing camera is not enough)4) I didn't get the wireless option to transfer my recorded video in SD card to any PC Laptop (Not everyone having NAS storage by the way, Team MI)5) When we initially setup this camera, we use wifi Dongle or Hotspot that is Ok, But supposed we don't have that Dongle available then we need to repeat complete setup of camera again for new WIFI connection, No options in MI Home Apps(Team MI please answer, Were you really serious before launching this product ?)6) sometime we need to adjust the camera position via online, it rotate its position some time less or vice versa7) when you are using this camera in night or low light, so switching between infrared and normal /low light Vision some tick tick sounds comes from camera (Why this so ?)Team MI now you have to answer .... are u serious ?8) When internet is down, there is no chance that you can login into camera and check and do trobleshooting9) I purchased 64GB card after buying this, So without memory card it not good to purchase10) MI Apps having recording video, but if we minimize the apps ot stop recoding,product is good but i am not happy with Software or Apps development team, they did not done their work with honesty"
39,puneet vikram singh,Very very very bad product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Image quality n night vision is gud bt the main part that's the connectivity is pathetic.. very bad product, it remains offline all the time .few days it worked well and later on all i could see was device offline instead of footage.Update: it has been more than a month and it keeps getting offline. Completely useless. Do not buy this."
40,Kundan Burnwal,Good picture quality. Buggy storage firmware,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera looks cute. Moves 360 degrees horizontally and even up and down from the app itself. Picture quality is good. Nigh vision is okay and so is motion detection.I did thorough research on multiple brands of WiFi home surveillance cameras of Mi, D3D and Sricam. Surprisingly, Mi is the only brand of cameras in which you can transfer the Videos on SD Card directly to the Laptop. In D3D all models, you need a SD Card export tool to even detect the SD card on laptop (SD Card doesn't get FAT32 format but some custom format which is unrecognised by Windows) and BTW that tool never worked for me on my Windows 10 laptop.So I went for Mi.However Mi has other basic issues with storage. Even in inserting a clean new 64 GB class 10 SD card, it would record videos for maybe only a few hours in a day as per its own whims and fancies, although the router and camera (including internet) are on 24*7 and within a couple of days it would show SD Card Error. And once it shows that, you don't know when it stopped the recording on SD Card. In that case, you need to unmount and remove the card, reboot the device and insert the card again and it may start recording. Otherwise, you would need to transfer the contents to laptop from SD Card (by removing the card from camera and inserting into Laptop card slot) and then format the card again before use.If you intend to store and retrieve continuous recording, the camera is not right. Otherwise it is fine. It also has an interesting NAS feature by which you can directly record to a windows laptop shared folder or a hard disk attached to router running SMB 1.0 legacy protocol. In about 50 trials only once I was able to sync it to NAS. Remaining time it just fails to list the shared folders and hence fails to synchronise the contents to NAS If you intend this to be used for storage and retrieval of the videos, don't go for any wireless network camera. None of the brands do a good job. You must go for the traditional wired ones with DVR only."
41,Abhishek J.,"Useful product, Good buy for home, but not 100% secured.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its already rated 4+ what else , it lives up to its expectation. Mine 3rd mi camera. The camera is good, night vision is good too, the features are very useful, hasselfree installation.Need a good wifi connection as using jiofi will buffer/ slow the video. Can control the movement and angle easily via ur smartphone but yes its slow.Also not 100% secured as the storage is within the camera itself and in case of emergency the entire camera setup can be stolen, wish they had cloud storage atleast 10 gb.Rest u may read the features to understand better."
42,Sandy,Worth your money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the best products purchased in the recent past. I was skeptical about Mi Cam and its features considering the price point. But surprisingly the product delivers excellent quality. The set up is easy and in a few seconds i got the camera up and running. The Mi Home App has a new UI and gives you a seamless viewing experience. The best part - you can share live feeds with multiple people. Haven't tested the motion de erection though. For best results, buy an sd card and plug it into the camera. This camera is definitely a value add and worth every penny. Not sure about the post sales services. Haven't encountered any problem till now"
43,Amit Singh,A perfect IP CCTV for modern homes!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  When initially I was searching for IP CCTV, I saw many negative comments that this Mi 360’ that you cannot take out video from it & blah blah but somehow I managed courage to buy. I can confirm that it is one of the best CCTV’s out in market. It gives a very slight movement alert which can directly be saved into your mobile or share over Whatsapp or anywhere. Also, if you need full long video over 1 minute then you either need to pull our sd card or you can play video on phone & play a screen recorder to record. Speed & performance is good & installation was too easy."
44,suresh subramani,GOOD BUT CAN BE BETTER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  OVERALL GOOD BUT THE FOLLOWING NEEDS ATTENTION.1.WHITE COLOR EASILY GETS DISCOLORED2.NO OPTION OF COPYING OR DOWNLOADING RECORDED VIDEOS TO PHONE WITHOUT REMOVING THE SD CARD IN MI HOME APP3.FAT32 SD CARD FORMAT IS REQUIRED. 64 GB HAS EXFAT FORMAT WHICH NEEDS REFORMATING WITH SOME SOFTWARES.4.AFTER SETUP WITH ONE ROUTER, NEEDS RESETTING TO CONNECT WITH OTHER ROUTERS IF YOU HAPPEN TO CHANGE THE ROUTER.NOT LIKE PHONE WI-FI.5.ONLY ONE MINUTE INTERVAL RECORDING. NO OTHER OPTIONS IN APP. ONE HOUR RECORDING WILL HAVE 60 VIDEOS FILES.6.NO AUDIO VOLUME CONTROL OPTION. EITHER NO VOLUME OR FULL VOLUME."
45,Shruti,Superb Review. Do read,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super product, easy to install.No issue in resuming operation after a power or internet reset. If you don't have an inverter, then black out time is about 50seconds. That's what it takes to resume after power is back.Motion detection is amazing. In my case, it even picks up leaf movement in the plants!!Picture quality is awesome.Sound 2 way is amazing. Just like a phone call.The only point of improvement:1. The time gap between motion detection instances could be given another option of 30seconds. If you set the recording to only when motion is detected, then it sometimes misses movements happened in less than 3 minutes.2. Chromecast support on the app would be good to cast live feed on the TVIn all, superb product from MI"
46,nauheed cyrusi,Highly Recomment - Best value for money home monitoring camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,  We got the camera mainly to keep an eye on our dog when hes alone at home and the product we've recieved is better than expected and checked all of the below boxes after 2 days of usage -- Easy to set up and install- Chic looking- Mi Home application is amazing with multiple customisations and automated features- 360deg rotation remotely from your phone- amazing motion detection and night visionOne minor hiccup of the experience was that intially the camera was not accepting the 64gb Sandisk SD card we bought separately. Howver later on we managed to insert it and smooth sailing ....
47,Midhun,Pretty impressive!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  ----First of all, you need a working internet connection. Compared to Mi SXJ02ZM 1080P Basic, camera clarity is better and remotely controllable rotation is very handy. But Mi SXJ02ZM 1080P Basic's camera output is wider than Mi MJSXJ02CM 360°. Still camera clarity in low light is way better in Mi MJSXJ02CM 360°.----With 32GB card, approx 3-4 days recording possible in 1080p and 64GB supports up to 7-8 days. After that the older file will be deleted. It can power with a power bank with 2A output. 20000mAh power bank suits better. Night vision is impressive in both cameras and in Mi MJSXJ02CM 360°, image looks sharper.----200KB/s upload and download speeds are enough for both cameras. It even works on 50KB/s upload speed, but buffering take some seconds. Buy Mi MJSXJ02CM 360° instead of Mi SXJ02ZM 1080P Basic."
48,VAIVIDHYAM,Overall I'll call it value for money although it has several limitations..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It consumes around 10gb of storage in 24hours in 'HD' mode.Pros :Night mode recording.Clarity of camera.Multiple users can watch camera recording at same time.Two way communication.1080p HD recording.Can record videos without internet , requires internet connection after switching camera on - after that you can disconnect & recording will continue.ICons:It doesn't support AUTO 360° rotation. User has to manually adjust camera from application.If there is a power outage or by any chance you disconnect power source , camera would start recording again after you connect it to internet.You need to keep camera connected to a power source for 24hours - charging option would've been helpful here.Application sometimes sends motion alerts after delay of 30minutes(approx).Memory card of storage capacity greater than 64gb are not supported."
49,Customer,Good product but requires further improvement.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It does it's job of surveillance inside the home. Pretty convenient to use, best is the 360 angle setting. The movement of camera is also noiseless, so no one will be aware if the camera is present or not. Status light can also be switched off for incognito. But night vision is next to horrible. It will detect a person during the night but fails to get a clear image of face. Would have been better if it had infrared light all around the camera such as the CP Plus/Hikvision. Didn't face any issue's while pairing with the apps like many users have complained. Yeah, there is lag in adjusting camera angels etc. If there is power outbreak, camera sometimes doesn't automatically come back to the same postion it was set up. Requires aligning again.It was a breeze to set up the app. Another suggestion to Xiaomi would be to let go off the micro usb port at the camera's end and make it a fixed end, for security reasons ofcourse. It's easier for anyone to just pull out the cable from the camera.Clarity during the day is adequate and apt for the price it is being sold at.5ghz support should be provided in next upgrade camera's and longer cable length option along with higher storage option. 64GB lasts for about a week in 1080p. 720p is horrible.Lastly, if you have an Android based TV/IOT box, you can download the app on your TV and you can live stream with much better screen ratio rather than your phone/ipad."
50,Elangovan,The best for single camera and with two or three days backup,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For a 64GB card you can get around 3 days. This works best with a regular internet connection to the device like any other monitoring cameras in the market.Looks good.Can be rotated, accessed via the Mobile application.The built in speaker is terrible and it is totally a marketing gimmick.The mic is ok and not that great.Not using the motion detection, so not sure of how it works.Better use for monitoring and cannot guarantee as a security device as the memory card stays in the camera unlike CCTV's."
51,Kalc,Pretty good,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Was checking out the different options available without going into an elaborate security system. Just a simple camera with motion detection and cloud storage options.This one from MI is small, well made and easy to setup with the MI home app. Though it does not provide cloud storage services per se, there is a default where any motion causes a 6-10 s clip to be stored and a notification sent to your phone. This essentially means that there is a default cloud storage service available for free and it stores information for 7 days. I think this is great, because in case there is a break in, the SD card storage option is almost useless. But this option will work by default. And it can take clips at afrequency of 3 minutes or more.One feature missing is tracking motion, the camera doesnt move to track motion - it remains in its position, you can only move it through the app. You can also talk through the app. These options are there in most such security cams from China. American brands are not officially here - so there is no support.Picture quality is very good. There are quite a few setup options."
52,ASR,Great value for money with easy to use app.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Setting up the camera is a breeze and it's a nice looking device.The image is nice and crisp when there's sufficient light and the switch to night vision happens automatically.The range is quite good - pan and tilt (left and right, top and bottom) movement. The only restriction if any is in the downward movement (as in it would have been nice if the camera could move down a little more).Two way communication is ok but not that great. So if the person is more than say 10 feet away from the camera, they are not likely to hear  you trying to reach them.Motion detection is excellent and easy to configure - makes for an ideal baby monitor.NOTE: Does not work on 5Ghz Wifi - this is a slight downer as it sits on the 2.4Ghz spectrum that is now very crowded.The previous one I purchased has an SD card in it and make it easy to track movement over the last 1-2 days.Overall a great product with good software to match the hardware."
53,nandan bharti,Perfect for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Could not have expected better in the price range. Only thing I miss is that when you set ‘recording video only during motion’ - it records video only for next 12 - 20 seconds. There is no option to increase the length of video - only other option is continuous recording which will finish the memory card of 64gb (maximum size permitted) in 6-8 days which need you to empty the card every week..which at times is tedious work.
54,Whats in the name?,Good quality product at reasonable price (iPhone users is facing issue read this),4.0 out of 5 stars,  Product is good quality as described. Very easy to setup. However has issue setting it up with iPhone. Always while connecting it used to give error time out. I had to do following:1) Set it up using an android phone.2) Once setup is complete login to your MI home app on iPhone and you will be able to access the camera.Not sure why it was giving error on iPhone.
55,Pepper,Can’t use as baby monitor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Low rating as it doesn’t serve my purpose. I bought it as a baby monitor. Little did I realise that when it’s on I cannot use my phone for anything else! It has to be open at the app and if I get a call or open some other app, I won’t be able to hear or get notified if my baby cries. So it’s not practical. Shouldn’t be listed under baby monitor and should just be under regular security camera section."
56,Rahul,Best - No It is Not. Dont Buy! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  - No Motion Tracking.  - It will not rotate when motion is detected.  - It will only alert via notification on your phone.- Only support Manual Rotation.  - No one is going to wake up mid night just to rotate camera manually.- No Echo Cancellation in Two Way Communication feature.  - It always make qu qu qu qu noise in 2 way communication. As it don't have echo cancellation.+ Best thing about this camera is only NAS storage option.Instead buy QUBO Smart Camera, or [Any other good Brand you like]https://www.amazon.in/QUBO-Smart-Home-Security-Camera/dp/B08446T2PR/+ Its from Hero [Indian Brand]+ IP65 Weather Proof+ Their Cloud is in India+ Echo Cancellation in Two Way CommunicationI hope it help you."
57,Liyo,The biggest problem with this camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This camera's great, the image quality, the motion detection, the ability to monitor remotely, they're all great but there's ONE MAJOR ISSUE:YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD RECORDED VIDEOS IN YOUR PHONE!Yup! It seems exceptionally dumb not to include this feature since the camera records videos into the SD card and you can view it on your phone. I've checked forums and everywhere, the only way you get your recorded footage is to remove the SD card from the camera and extract the footage.Other people have a workaround where they do run a screen recording software to save the footage while it's playing back, the only issue with that is that if it buffers or faces any glitch, those will be recorded as well.Seriously, I thought by now a software patch would fix it, but there's no hope..In conclusion, don't buy this camera if you want to use it like a security camera and save videos ***insert face palm emoji***"
58,Rajpal,Not Worth IT . It has good Specks no Doubt but not reliable,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera goes Offline all the time .Within a year stopped working as well. Now thinking should I throw it in dustbin or get it repaired or what. Wastage of money trust me. I have complete home automated and telling you complete wastage of money for indian homes . There is no support or custom firmware as well to flash and use it as per my requirement . All the youtube reviews and samples are correct and to some extent good .But real life we need this to be installed and used on daily basis and there it fails. Cannot connect sd card beyond 64GB. NAS is also getting frequently disconnected. Not sure its worth recommendation to any one.Yes if you really hate someone and want them to waste time in trying to keep this camera online for rest of there life .Gift them this camera .
59,Varun,Best camera for the price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its the best Security camera for the price range with couple of limitations. I have been using it past 4 months.Night mode works better than any other camera.For Home monitoring, alerts are sent within 1 minute depending on your internet speed. I use 100mpbs & get instant alerts with the movements. It records 1min video for every movement when home monitoring is turned on.32gb card covers 3 days of recording in HD mode. You can see all the recordings in the app only & easy to check specific date & time.Picture quality is commendable."
60,Ravinder,Bestest camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you take my word, buy without a second thought. I bought one earlier and now getting a second one. These days, surveillance is essential in many ways. A boss may want to watch whether his employees are working well. A mother working in office might want to see if the maid is taking care of her baby properly or not. One can see previous recordings on mobile and can tilt the camera and zoom as well. In my opinion, this camera at this price point is a lottery. Go buy it and get peace of mind."
61,Echofriend,No words except for SUPER GOOD,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall the product is very good it does this work perfectly and you can operate it from anywhere you like.Motion direction is very good it stores clip videos of 2 to 3 minutes as in the settings.Pro:- Can be mounted anywhere within the range of Internet.Cons:- Only one wall mounting bracket Is provided with the set.My suggestion is multiple brackets and colour options will make it more reachable.
62,The J J,Best product so far in IP enabled cameras with SD card support.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A must buy for home or (Small shop/office).When you don’t want more then 2 or 3 cameras and waste your money on DVR and Harddisk And wiring and all the other charges for the complete setup this camera is highly recommended. Setup is very easy. Before installing on a wall make sure you leave at least a 2-3 inch gap from all the sides. Supports upto 64GB (format of card happens  within its mobile app) works on both android and iOS. Fingerprints lock and passcode lock can be set in app. It will update its firmware once you finish setting up with your Wi-Fi. Only supports 2.4Ghz connection. No LAN ports on it purely on Wi-Fi. Dual way Audio works smooth. Minimum speed for HD viewing and dual side audio working I say at least 3-4Mbps(3000-4000Kbps).
63,Amazon Customer,best at the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought two cameras after seeing the performance of the first camera. way cheaper than installing an entire system of surviellance camera. Best to buy a 128 GB memory card along for 10 days recording 24X7 (memory gets auto deleted when full).Got the second one a little bit defective but customer care promises replacement with original box package. so waiting for replacement with a lost package request. hope MI wont disappoint for a silly box package
64,John Doe,Great Easy to use Surveillance camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Setup was a breeze and very user friendly . I installed it both on my Android as well as Ipad Pro and it was a breeze to setupcamera quality is decent , however it could have been sharper with a little more clarity . Night vision is phenomenal.For the Price and easy of setup it is a great product.A good feature using the Mi app is that u can have multiple cameras all around the house and using the App you can access all , which is a plus point."
65,Femin,Best budget security camera with very high motion detection capabilities and clarity.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Easy to setup. The camera clarity is awesome. Motion detection is awesome too. Even the fly flying near is  send as a notification stating ""Motion detected in watch area"" to the registered Mobile. Night vision is decent enough to capture faces in short distance..Motion detection 10/10Clarity 10/10Build quality 7/10360 recording capabilities - not auto only manualStorage - In 64 GB memory card you can store 1080p for 1 full week atleast. It also support storage devices which has NAS that is made available in wifi network."
66,Chitti babu,Defective,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received defective product, it didn't connect to network, I returned it"
67,Talib,Worth the money you pay,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I guess this is the best motion detection / night vision / wifi enabled security camera. Its motion detection alert is nice, not 100% but works fine. Night vision picture quality is impressive... Supports upto 64GB card which can take video back up of 1 week in 1080p resolution.. CON is that the speaker is very very very low.. Cannt hear even if you are 1mtr away... Rest of the things are very well taken care of"
68,Supriya Sarraf,Average camera.No hotspot.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is average , don't expect much for this price. The only drawback/ limitations with Mi cameras is that they are useless for people and places where there is no Internet otherwise ok. Simply not useful for rural areas of India because still 85% of Indian Territory is rural underdeveloped  where people are restricted from the approach of Internet.I think Mi should look into this issue seriously and add hotspot feature in their coming updates .So that people without internet can access the camera with their cell phones."
69,Amit santhalia,Very poor camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very poor interfaceMost of the time camera goes offlineFor no reasonIt’s been more than 15 days ,but no recordings yetI suggest buy sricamThis one is. Not worth the money"
70,dharmender malik,Worth it,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice camera with good picture quality. Easy to install. First of all download MI-home app creat account and add device. Cover 360 degree with good views. Easy to monitor both on wifi and the GPRS INTERNET. only lagging feature is small storage of only 64GB which store only 7-10 days recording only.
71,Abhi,Super product from Mi,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Very good product for internal as well as covered external area. Please don’t go by other reviews that question its ability to detect motion or connect in external network. I am using this product for the last month or so wherever I go!! Super product. The only downside is that it doesn’t have PC version of Mi Home app. But it works like a charm on as many phones you like.
72,TechnoCrazy,"Perfect device for home, Value for Money",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It has been effortless to configure this marvellous piece of tech. Picture quality is super clear and works perfect for real time surveillance. I read a few reviews where people have complained about recording starting again after a power cut. What do you expect from an electronic device? Please keep a Ups or invertor for your WiFi and camera power source.Pros:1) superior picture quality for this price2) almost 360 degrees rotation3) card slot for checking older records4) super easy to install via app5) value for money6) freedom to keep an eye from anywhere7) two way calling is additional feature8) takes commands to rotate immediately9) No lag on a shared 40 mbps connection10) auto starts after a power cutCons:None basically, its pro gradeTwo way audio can be slightly betterAn option to watch via Mi Web interface would have given more flexibility to monitorGo ahead buy it without a second thought, you will be happy.Have been using since a year with no problems"
73,Ani,Good product with some shortfall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is good, video and picture quality is very sharp. Issue is it's easily detachable, that is simply twist and done. A person can simply steal it. Also it not water resistant so have to be more careful choosing the place for installation. Sound call quality is ok many a times it echoes. Overall good product for the Priya but some the items pointed above can't be ignored"
74,vijay,Disappointed with the callback feature!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mi Security camera is viable for those who want to monitor the house with the low budget.The reason i got product is MI says it supports features such as Talk back(two way communication ) .For me the talk back  feature was a great value and i got one for myself .However , the talk back doesnt work as excepted most of the times and when it works the volume is too low and no one can hear.I had also had discussion with the Mi Technical team but of no use.I would Really like if MI works on the talk back feature ."
75,Govind Menon,Best in class,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Fantastic. Definitely worth the price. Bought this to monitor my pet at home. Works well with zero light and can be remotely controlled via app. It can be twisted and turned and even has voice capability to hear what's happening in the room where cam is fixed and to even talk thru the camera so it can be heard at the other endVery pleased with the purchase. Great value for money. Build quality is good too. More than enough for a layman's use.
76,Renjith Vamanan,Good product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using this product for the last one month. Got one more as the first one met my expectations. Worth the price. Setting up is very simple. It has got good range. I had used other makers products, but this one seems to be of good qualityThe cons for this product are: the zoom level is very low. The app doesn't have a preset to store different camera which other makers have and its a very useful feature."
77,Sudip9,Great Product. Must Buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Its one of the best home monitoring products. Extremely easy to setup in steps as under...Just plug it on. Install the MI Home App ( avl for both ios and Android)Add your device. Device will prompt you to scan a QR code present on your phone. Once the QR is scanned by the cam on your mobile... That's itNow put a memory card. Format it through the app. Rename your cam and start monitoring. Great picture quality. Good wide angle.  Too good night vision. It's a must have. At this price nothing of this sort is available.
78,Amazon Customer,Nice product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Design looks cute but bit bulky, camera quality and app works perfectly,i fund bit dificult while paring the device because of QR scan and its not paring with vodofone WIFI dont no the reason but jio wifi works good, Note this is not good for outdoor and Mobile wifi(depends on ur network in your location), I hope broadband rooter works good for this,2 way talk back is aswome and louder, night vesion is so clear. Worth for money"
79,Manish,Best Camera under 3000,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros :Night mode recording.Simple to install.Clarity of camera.Multiple users can watch camera recording at same time.Two way communication- but voice is not too loud1080p HD recording.Can record videos without internet , requires internet connection after switching camera on - after that you can disconnect & recording will continue.Cons:It doesn't support AUTO 360° rotation. User has to manually adjust camera from application.You need to keep camera connected to a power source for 24hours - charging option would've been helpful here.Application sometimes sends motion alerts even mosquito fly in front of him.Memory card of storage capacity greater than 64gb are not supported.More information you can find it on my youtube channel ""Technical Chaharji"". Just remember to order memory card separately as it's not given with device"
80,Harminder S.,Total failure,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought two of these one from Amazon and the other from the MI store in Nainital. It worked well for a short time but now every one week or so it stops functioning and you need to format memory card over and over again and to by pass that you need to switch of manually the power and that's useless all together. Surprisingly the cheaperbasic home model  doesn't have this problem so it's a bloody waste of money better of to pay more and upgrade to a more efficient  Vendor
81,MANISH,"Go for it, without second thought.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everything perfect and suitable for the purpose which I was looking from a security camera. Only thing which is not a weakness but I prefer to opt in upgraded version and that is automotion to capture the object which will be perfect with the motion capture.Pros: Good Quality,Motion capture,Smooth App,Always Active,Silent,Wi-Fi connectivity,Control it from anywhere,Reasonable pricing,Easy to install.Cons:-1.Continue Electricity require.2.No connectivity of LED/monitor, only you can view from mobile app for which continue supply of Internet require for both camera and mobile app(but this is not problem if you don’t want to monitor through mobile)"
82,K,Buggy camera that cannot record with suspicious supporting phone software - typical chinese trash,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is really typical Chinese quality for the price. I had to exchange the first time because the sd card would not ""lock"" into the camera's globe.Construction quality is good.The night vision, motion detection and picture quality are all okay but what use is it if it cannot record for more than 12 seconds at a time when a motion is detected? That motion includes a headlight shining as a car goes by so the camera wont record until a minimum 3 more minutes has lapsed after those 12 seconds. So even if a bank is looted and you want to catch some robbers you better ensure it happens during those few seconds!The camera is very glitchy and unstable. Sometimes it keeps switching on and off from night vision giving you a clicking sound and the video going full white to normal every few seconds. You will have to do a restart. Thankfully the rotating (pan and tilt) feature to move the camera work, when it works.And the software cannot be trusted from this chinese company. Why would you need mandatorily all those permissions like location for the App to even start? My samsung phone restarts occasionally ONLY when I start this Mi app. For all you care they could be assembling a mega network of cameras, routers (huawei) and what not to be used in information warfare.Please note the picture quality is not so good that you can zoom for details so you will have to make do with what you get of a person's face at say 10 to 15 feet. So this cannot be used for a perimeter security camera. Choose the professional setup.One plus long though - when it works, the patching through of the video output from the camera to the cell phone via the app is seamless and stable. No ip address settings,encryption worries etc. However that brings to my mind, can you trust this setup in terms of privacy and security?This is just a toy. I get that is what we get for this price."
83,Amol Takale,Not satisfied. Compulsory Wifi required to rec in card,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not good product. No manual recording is possible on SD card.Compulsory internet connection is required to start recording on SD card.Need to reset the camera multiple time to connect after disconnecting from wifi.QR code is also not generated and scanned efficiently.  Takes time.Overall bot satisfied by this product. Manual recording should be allowed without connecting to wifi.
84,MAHESH,Features and suggestions,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This Wifi camera has amazing picture quality but show a few second later.This product is economy friendly and best quality product in this range.This camera not have battery backup. So during power falier we can't able to check video.I suggest to company please add power backup feature in it.Please provide some cloud storage.Because some time thief/stranger take away this camera we can't check footage
85,Arjun,Good product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Used this product for more than 2 months now. Good product for the price. Motion detection sometimes shows false positives and doesn't show certain motion by specific people (which is very weird). However, all video being captured, you can always view it later and identify any motion/movement.Night vision is decent. The call function works well, as long as you have a decent internet connection.If possible, periodic automatic swivel of the camera should be added. That would make this a great product at this price."
86,drcdk,Amazing essential every living room needs it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great quality product, very good packing ,once paired with the we code it works great , auto re connects even after power failure , motion detection is good,night vision is amazing,no need to worry , always can have a watch on your loved one, no need to worry about your family when you are away , good connectivity , one can use even without a memory card because it uses the cloud storage unless you need long recordings , only con is no other colour available would have loved if it's in black or brown to suit the room decor"
87,Navin Abraham,Good camera for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For the people who are having trouble getting the camera to detect the QR code on your phone, try reducing your phone's display brightness. It easily detects the QR code then. (do note that this is true only when you are indoors under normal lighting conditions). Another issue that I faced, and took 2-3 hours to resolve was during the next step - connecting to my home WiFi. The process would fail each time showing the error message ""Bring device closer to router"" although I had kept the camera right next to the router. I was on the verge of returning the device, when suddenly it struck me; I had been entering the wrong WiFi password. When you are trying to connect the camera to your WiFi, the app does not inform you that the password is incorrect if you have entered a wrong one. It simply says that it failed to connect. So we need to always figure out what could have gone wrong first, before giving up. Now after the successful set up, I'm not facing any issues. I will update the review after a few months."
88,Amazon Customer,Insufficient product information,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera is ok. The product shld have guidelines on the type/speed of wifi connectivity required to operate this. Without a very strong router & high speed internet (80 mbps & above) the camera does not work. So though I have bought it long back, still unable to use due to lack of high speed wifi connection & suitable router."
89,sreeya,AFTER WARRENTY NO SERVICE ..... FOR Mi MJSXJ02CM 360° 1080P WiFi Home Security Camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased it in MAR'2019. PAST SOMANY MONTHS ITS NOT WORKING TODAY I WENT TO  SERVICE CENTER  AND U/STAND THAT THIS CAMERA COMES UNDER ACCESSORISES CATEGORY, SO IT CANT BE SERVICED AFTER WARRANTY PERIOD (I.E. 6 MONTHS )  I  AGREED FOR PAID SERVICE SINCE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.IT IS VERY BAD ON THE PART OF THE MI, SUCH A reputed brand is not giving service after warranty.....in this case it is not advisable to buy the product from MI.... ITS waste of money......"
90,Ankur Bhardwaj,The product has stopped working within a month,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this product for about a month now and everything seemed to work fine. However, few days back the app has stopped buffering the live feed. I did hard reset, reinstalled the app and the problem still continues. I contacted the customer service but they gave me to cover the same steps which i already did. Now, have to replace it via customer support."
91,Siddharth,Exceptional home security camera.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So, I bought this product as it's holiday season and we'll be out for some time. I wanted a home security coverage and the ones with DVR were proving to be costly (for home), so here we are.There are very race occasions when I buy a gadget ( I do buy a lot) and is appreciated by my wife, otherwise it same as usual 'was it necessary' line.Having said that, the camera is still exceptionally good, the setup is gas and within 5 min you are good to go. The app is well made and has clean setup. Camera design and form factor is above oar than test of the competition (CP plus).It takes clean and clear vid with motion detection. The notifications are almost simultaneous.One area where I encountered problem was (no fault of the camera). The router had to be with WPA2 minimum security and not WEP. The camera will not latch on if the security settings of router is low. The security of the router can be upgraded with minimal effort from browser (YouTube vid are available).Other than this I encountered no problem whatsoever (including as some reported facing problem in scanning QR code). Top notch worth every rupee.May not be water proof, haven't checked that out I am using it indoors.Additional storage is required (max 64 gb class 10 SD card).Overall a lovely product and a great buy.The delivery of product was on time and we'll packed. Good job by the seller and Amazon logistics."
92,Adnan,MI Camera doesnt connect with Samsung Phones.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  MI Camera is not compatible with Samsung devices. I have got Samsung Galaxy S8 and the device cant connect with it, it connects with One Plus devices though. It seems MI did not do proper testing with major phones like Samsung Galaxy series before doing the commercial launch. Even a 77 MB MI Home software was shown as 90 MB in Samsung device i.e while downloading it said downloaded 90/77 MB, which is more than actual software.  If I cant connect my S8 with MI camera and MI Home software then whats the use. I need support on this."
93,nitin,not trustful for sensitive location,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Good partgood picture quality and look in ideal conditionsworst part1.frequent auto logout of application2. device auto unregistered from the application. you have to again configure it .i have purchased 5 pieces and need to reconfigure almost every week .have no clue why?3.you can't connect it with your big screen4.internet connection is must.5.user manual never tells you that what should be the exact location to installed it.every time power goes it will move to its default locationseems these are not made for outdoor purposes.
94,prasenjit biswas,Good but NOT the Best. features missing,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Like1. Picture quality is good.2. Setup and installation is easy.3. App has good features.4. Video compression is good which takes less memory.Dislike1. Each video recording is of 1 minute only which is really frustrating to watch later.2. You need very good internet connection to watch live otherwise it keeps on buffering.3. No facility to watch on computer. You can only watch through mobile app.4. If its connected to Wifi A and if you want to change to Wifi B, you need to press reset button on camera which is inconvenient depending on your installation.If you want to buy it, decide after reading all its cons which can become headache later. Otherwise some lesser known brands has more complete features."
95,Rajnish,Excellent security camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pro's:Easy to install.Easy to connect.Clear voice during talk-back.Nice, clear images and videos.Coloured video in low light also.Good, clear night vision with a good range.Excellent motion detection.Easy to control through app.IR LEDs are not visible to naked eyes at night so the camera can not be spotted in the dark.Con's:Repeated motion detection notification cannot be set below 3 minutes. So there is no repeated motion detection notification for movements in those 3 minutes.It would have been better if it can be set to 30 seconds, or atleast 1 minute.Overall, an excellent security camera."
96,Cenosure,Steal or Neel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  After reading all reviews carefully i thoght to buy this product to detect stealing activities often happening in my flat. For few days i was worry free.. but then i realized, irrespective of gud vision and detection technique, there is a big flow in the camera.. anyone with MI account can add this device without my permission and can control its detection accordingly.. there is no device level security which can stop un-authorized ppl to use the same for security compromised.. also the best part to deal with a cunning thief is that.. either of wifi or electricity hindrence can easily disable the camera.. there is no battery backup designed.. so i decided to took a bit different prevention method"
97,Anupam Thakur,Very happy with the product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this product.It is easy to set up using the app.Easy to add SD card.Good video quality.Very good sound quality(microphone ) .Small in size.Multiple person can watch and control the camera if access give.Very good motion detection.Very good night vision.You can't talk through camera (feature as mentioned by the manufacturer), but this feature is not needed in the camera."
98,Pompi,MI 360° camera is superb,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is an excellent product from MI. The plastic/pvc material used is rich enough. Lookwise it is flawless. It serve the purpose of close-circuit camera. No need to put wires throughout the wall and also no need to buy DVR for storage. Only you need to have a broadband connection. It would be difficult to connect thru jiofi or other wifi dongle. So if it is connected thru broadband it will give a superb performance. You need to download Xiaomi Home from play store to establish the connection. All you need to put a micro sd card(64 GB) to store the viewings. Alerts will be sent to your mobile whenever any motion occurs in the vicinity of the lens.It has serve all my purpose of CCTV camera. No need to spend 15000 to 20000 Rs anymore.
99,Tajammul,"Go for it, worthy of every penny spend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Okay folks, writing this review after almost 3 weeks of usage.First thing first, this is indoor cam needs WiFi and power plug (USB power is also fine) and a Mi account for proper functioning.Here it's ok important info:Want to use in multiple phones with full control, just use the same Mi account which was used for installation.There's a share option in the app, which does not have a full control on the cam.There is a 2 way communication also available, need little improvement.Overall fully satisfied"
100,AJAY EKKA,Lovely product for home,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This review is after 5 months of usage.The product quality, picture , videos and server NAS storage on cloud. Everything is amazing. This is the best Mi product i have used. Recently i bought the second one too because its affordable. Only thing is you need a wifi at home with unlimited package as it consumes good amount of data when put on 24 hrs survillence. There is one more feature sleep mode you can put time when it will not record."
101,Bandi,"Excellent cctv, been looking for long time. Loving it",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I fixed this on my desktop to watch my family as most of the time I am at office. Motion detector is too good. It even triggers if mosquito flies near camera. 2 Way speaking is superb. Picture clarity is Excellent. Its the best. Only drawback,we cannot watch via computer. Its very secured. Not possible to hack in as you need to show the bar code reader next to camera from mobile to install."
102,SOnal Babre,Nice product as a home CCTV camera.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am very happy with this product, it'd perfect as a home Cctv camera. All I had to do was down load mi home app, add the device to the mobile app, connect the camera to charger, then to WiFi, and scan the qr code, that's it. The picture quality is very clear and night mode is also clear. The only hind side is you will have to plug in the camera till the time you want recording and the device needs to be close to router- WiFi. Over all I am very satisfied with the product."
103,AP.Singh,"A must have for your valuable home & family, great quality at great affordability",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great image quality 1080P, happy with it.. Well designed , looks and feels superior compared to others..Doesn't make any sounds while moving camera left/right or up/down while monitoring through the app.Easy & slightly tricky too at the same time to install, procedure to connect is easy but the app is funny.ther issue faced is that I couldn't share the camera through the a""pp share function"" easily with my family so that any one could monitor when needed. It took a while to some how get it done and you also need to approve the rights for others to hear and speak through the camera.They need to fix this to make it perfect !!While monitoring it reconnects automatically if disconnected and has the time running on the upper left corner which indicates its actively running n connected,its quite tiney though but okay.Happy & disappointed..Happy with the quality from A to Z ""Build/Image Quality"" as well as the microphone & speaker are loud enough & the image quality is great too whether day or night.DISAPPOINTED - with the app !! Tooo confusing for the most simplest of things & though the image quality its great it lacks contrast in night mode if the camera is pointing down completely while placed on a hight then its own body reflects of the INFRARED creating a slight contrast issue so best is to install camera vertical on wall for quality image.Its a 5 star for me overall otherwise for me a big fan of MI products already own few WIFI Bulbs and Air Purifier which are awesome."
104,NEELESH 17,Go for it..... Excellent,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Best camera for home monitoring
105,Sundeep yadav,Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The overall performance of this product is good.Pros : Good picture qualityLong usb cable - 1.5 mtrAuto switch to night vision camera.Can monitor from any part of the country with a good wifi connectivity on both the side.Cons : No Ip rating that is ; Its not a waterproof camera to use outside.Very late notification for motion detection.Once you turn the power off it switch off too you cannot view through app during power cut.Only 68 gb memory support.
106,Manoj Nair ,Excellent,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its been a week and usage experience is excellent so far.Haven't been able to check motion detection and playback on app isn't working either, despite having a memory card inserted in it.Probably need to know/learn proper usage of app to get the playback working.Wish to hope movement of camera stays the same post usage of couple months, without any trouble."
107,G BALAJI,Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Quality is very good brand warenty easy to use and i thank Amazon very much because i first ordered one MI 360 camera which was mic not working i raised for replacement after two days i received new product and it works fine. I once again thank amazon for quick replacement. Thank u Amazon..
108,Calvin Nirmal,No value for Money and time,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Got the camera with good packing & condition.But the camera couldn't scan the QR code. I tried for almost 1 day. no use. i returned it and got replacement. but the same issue.This is simply waste of time and money. I suggest not to buy and waste your time and money.No customer support.
109,Paranoid Android,"Great for baby sleep monitoring, awesome  middle class fancy!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It has made life so easy especially when you need to look after your kids or pets while working. Having the SD card tucked beneath the lens is quite neat. You can keep a watch and it's portable enough to be moved from one room to another. It can also be mounted on a wall vertically if needed which is a +.I'm very happy with the purchase. No matter what people say, Xiaomi has indeed brought in a lot of accessibility with their products in India. Last decade now seems like dark ages with so much tech available now a days."
110,Kiran,Super Easy Super Cool Worth money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super Easy to install and operate... impressed with the product design n qualityOnly down part is the Voice Call feature -speaker is not loud enough to operate at highest output in outside conditionsMic is super sensitive, and we can clearly hear the outside sounds...Definitely a Go for it,if you want to make your home more safe n secure"
111,AD,"Good quality picture , easy to use and worth in this price",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good quality , easy to install and very easy to sync with app.thing which I need is1.power backup.2.Once sync with one system or account , then there should not be easy way to use by other, so that no one can alter it.3. Camera should move to direction where it listen sound (if install properly) , current you can move 360 degree and approx 35-45 degree up and down it using app manually.4. Please provide some accessories for hanging it outside in house corner and edges so that it can cover both direction."
112,NIMT,Extremely frustrating after sales service = NO SERVICE,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had purchased this camera on 17th Feb 2020. My camera stopped working in the month of June. I raised the issue to Amazon and they told me to contact and I did the same. When the camera was sent to the service centre for repair/replacement it was not even checked on the pretext of not carrying the original box. I have the original accessories, invoice, warranty slip and even order summary. But MI says all of these is useless as the box is not carried. Raised the issue to the customer support through email as well as call over 15 times and this is the response after a month of follow up ""I would like to inform you that your complaint WOIN20200713000085 was escalated to the team and this has been updated from the team side that we want a box of MI HOME SECURITY CAMERA 360""MI has once again proven that their after-sales protocol is not customer friendly. Nowhere at the time of purchase was it mentioned either by MI or Amazon to keep the box safe in order to avail the warranty. Nothing was mentioned on the product page, invoice, box or anywhere else then how is it the customer's fault to not keep the box. Even after having the Invoice, Warranty slips the box is an excuse to dodge a small warranty complaint. So yes the review is simple, the product is fine but be ready for absurd excuses when the time comes for after-sales services by MI."
113,Sri,useless for me,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera may be ok, I dont know because I couldnt even install it.  It requires atleast two smart phones one to scan the QR code and another in which wifi communication with camera is done.  I dont have wifi except hotspot and I have onlly one smartphone.  I dont know why company's make so sophisticated things that they become useless unless you have all the accessories beforehand in your house."
114,Chandrashekhar Kurre,Awesome For Indoor,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera is good for indoor Home security beacua it is not water and dust proof. But you can use it for outdoor purpose if there not water contact directly or by any mean. Outdoor its function is also good and 360 degree view is brilliant but need is aided precaution like covering by plastic or glass jar.Two way voice connectivity is good . Night vision is brillient .Voice recording also do not disappoint you. But online monitoring requires good internet connection.
115,Amazon Customer,Great camera. Easy to setup and share device with multiple family members.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great camera. Very easy to setup once you install the mi home app. Needs constant power supply and internet connection. You can share the camera with family members. Allows you to remotely watch the video and monitor. The camera can be controlled remotely from the app, allows for rotating the camera 360 degrees horizontally. Has provision for inserting sd card to record video which can then be rewind and played (through the app)."
116,Optimus,Excellent camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love this Camera was a little ify some reviews said intercom was not good.. But I guess I lucked out and got good piece it works great. I have it set up at the shop I can communicate with my employees great, good picture quality.. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.. Definitely a bargain compared to the cctv camera units. 64gb card records for a week. Excellent for small businesses"
117,prashant V,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's class product.  It gets easily connected with app. Follow all instructions on app n it's ready to use.  You all need Wi-Fi in home to use this camera n to access it from remote areas where u need to just on ur data on Mobile. Mi home app is user-friendly n it's good product in low price. U can connect more cameras in different locations at ur home offices using single app.  U can share ur live videos with another mi app user.Go for it no need extra HD n any other device.1. Camera2. Active wify3. Data in ur mobile.Best product.
118,Vitthal kumbhare,Mi CCTV camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera is not connecting to mobile and error says as connection timed out.
119,Siddharth Jain,Three Big Issues because of which I returned it,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Three big issues with the product1. 2 Way audio sound from the device is extremely low. Even if you stand next to it, you cant hear it.2. It cannot be connected to an external service for recording. Only memory card3. It does not have motion tracking i.e. if the subject moves from left to right, it does not move along with it."
120,Vinay Hatwal,Super amazing IP camera with this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Truly speaking, I have searched a lot of IP cameras for my home, but finally I have chosen Mi MJSXJ02CM 360° 1080P WiFi Home Security Camera (White). This is really a terrific product from Xiaomi. I think you can trust on this product otherwise I have also read that these cameras send the information on some overseas locations as a spy. I am using it may be from a couple of weeks and till now this is working perfectly. Here is some valuable information about this product.Pros-------1. Beautiful design like a toy. you will love it's design.2. Compact design, small in size in comparison with other cameras.3. Two very good quality of motor to make it rotate.4. Almost Silent rotations.5. Very easy to connect.6. Very good picture quality.7. Call back feature.8. Night vision is extraordinary, Clearly visible in a deep dark room.9. Play back feature with the live footage so that you can view live and old recording from the sd card on one screen.10. A very good application to handle the camera.11. App is able to create smart scenes perfectly.12. Motion detection is really very good.13. Password protected.14. You can share this device with your family members.15. You can access the camera from anywhere in the word if your local area network is connected to the WAN.16. NAS (Network-attached storage) is just wow. You can record your footage on your network.Cons (But really these do not impact much.)------1. The power cable is micro usb cable and can be easily detach with the camera. However it is an advantage but a disadvantage too if you are fixing the camera outside of you home.2. The thing that I miss with this camera, is a windows/mac application where we can view the camera on our computer's monitor. Hopefully Xiaomi will provide it is future.3. A very bad thing is we can only view one camera at a time. It would really be good if MI can provide multiple camera view on a single screen (Some camera's apps already provide the same feature).4. No RJ45 connectivity, only WiFi.Overall the camera is really a good option to buy. It has all the features that no other single camera provides. Go for it without thinking. Value for money."
121,PB,A good buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A good buy. Got this to stay in touch with my old parents.++Picture quality is good.Light weightsimple to installSupports multiple phones to connect- -Voice calling is not too great.Motion detection takes 3 mins or more to update u. This can be improvedStill need to check night vision. But don’t expect too much hereIt’s been 3 days but so far it seems good
122,Harsh,Awesome product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  On youtube some guys are not liking this product, but let me share the feed back. I am using this product from last 7 days and no issues at all. Camera build quality is prefect. day and night vision is awesome. This is only for home inside use not for outside. I will recommend this camera to all the amazon members. Please check settings as per your requirement you will get all the options. Soon I will update the pics as well and update the video on youtube"
123,dhiren,Not Working,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I opened the box, took out the camera, powered it up, it started rotating and then it started talking. After that the yellow light is on and can't connect.  I cant reset. Every time i turn it on the yellow light is up and constant."
124,S. Shastri,Not reliable,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Have been using two of these for some time. There are times it won't connect even though there are no issues with the internet At other times when you want to look at playback will say Rutgers is no card to when there is and after sometime it will go into playback. I don't recommend this camera as it is not consistently goid
125,Arvind Gaba,Excellent Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Never imagined that CCTV can be of this good quality. The phone feature is truly amazing, can talk to anyone for any long. Can be used indoors, the Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a very smart option. The quality of the video is very good. If there is any way to enhance the audio quality, it would be a great experience."
126,Amazon Customer,OKiish,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  To be fair this is the cehapest 360 camera and it works kinda ok (just ok )After 4 months of use in winters the cameras stopped working ( I bought 3 and all stopped working like they won't turn ON)But as I said you can't buy anything this cheap but yea I kinda had that feeling that it won't be very good becuase it's a Chinese product LOLPros:1.)Nightvision is quite good2.) It's wireless and you can watch it live on your phone if your connected to the same wifi ( it doesn't use internet though it's just for mi account login but you still need internet to view it )3.)Cons:1.) Camera quality sucks for a 1080p camera MI should stop flexing about a 1080p resolution2.)Frequent switchoff randomly3.) I was hoping that I could somehow connect it to another spare wifi i had lying but i couldnt ,it still needs internet4.) There are no updates from MI and there are a lot of bugs in the MI home app"
127,Sankar,only black and white video,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This was the second camera that i purchased. First one works properly.This one records video in black and white.  Need to get it serviced to fix the issue.
128,Aditya Saxena,Review after 2 month's of constant usage.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   Guys have a look at the video that I have uploaded, you will be very clear on your decision to buy this camera or not."
129,Deepak Arora,360 degree with excellent camera quality. Two way sound and playback makes it extraordinary.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This camera is the best in this range. You will get recording saved for each minutes and also you can playback the video in one go for any particular period. Using 64 gb memory card I can save around 7 days video. The video quality, night vision, 360 degree rotation is great. Also it is not waterproof but I have got it installed outside and the heavy rainfall did not have any effect in this I am sure it is durable. Also using NHS I can save all the videos on laptop it just needs to be connected using a same wifi."
130,Kritesh,Perfect Security Camera with some Minor issues,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera works perfectly. You wont get a better security camera for this Price.The setup was hassle free and I had the camera up and running in less than 5 minutes. Wall mounting was a piece of cake too.The video quality, talk back feature ans night vision all work seamlessly. I have connected the camera to 3 phones at home and again, the setup was just perfect.However, one issue I have with the camera is delayed notifications for any movement detection. Sometimes the notifications come as late as 6 hours. This defeats the whole purpose of motion detection.  I dont know if this a camera issue or wifi issue (I am using broadband and have had no issues with speed or link).Other than this issue, I am completely satisfied with this camera."
131,Sebinraj.C.A,Good product but still need some improvements,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good product. Best quality videos.But the videos that records automatically and stored in the SD card last only 1 min. After 1 min another video will be saved. So in 1 hr you will see 60 small video clips. It would be better if it can record videos for 1 hr continuesly or any setting to change the recording duration. Even the customer care at MI doesn't know much in detail about this product.Other than this, the product is really worth buying. Amazon team supports very well."
132,Devraj,Amazing product with few important improvements,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is a Big concern that how we can retrieve cloud stored recordings in case of theft, this camera was only recommended caz it had monitoring feature but i have found that we can only view the recordings only when cameras are online but in case of theft that won't be possible.It's been more than 16 weeks now (edit and added above section) since I have received this, Product is good for indoor usage.Picture quality is goodProduct app is goodRecording facilities availableIssues or improvementsMotion detection is too sensitive even it gets activated when a fly goes around.2) They need to improve two way talk back .. better provide a Bluetooth speaker support so that voice can be communicated via bluetooth speaker.Update after 2 month :I feel MI has improved the Talk back in recent software update .. Still waiting the bluetooth connectivity with Speaker..I have also installed sd card and woow .. I can access my SD card video as well make the camera to store videos over cloud using surveillance mode ... I am not very sure how long the company keeps video recording on their servers ..Thats Still a open question and concern."
133,CheMah,WOW... that's all I will say,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Congratulations to MI tech team of having such a wonderful product at such a reasonable cost. I am quite please with everything that MI camera offered. Reducing one star only because it did not provide a wall flexible angle to fix in the wall. The key good things to highlight are1. Quality of the camera is excellent. It feels very sturdy2. Camera look and feel is sleek3. Camera quality to  distance of 20 meters as well is great4. Camera can easily be operated on the app5. The app features are simple to follow and provides great features to watch playback, sleep mode, motion detection, video quality settings, password protected app6. Storage could have been a bit more then 64GB as storing for atleast 20 to 25 days is needed7. Ease of installation8. Packaging was great and showcases product qualityThe next thing thAt MI team should focus is battery operated cameras which can work by charging the battery like mobile phones and hence will not require any power to function.Recommend anyone to just blindly go for it as you won't find anything comparable in this competitive price range."
134,Amit Arora,Impressive home camera useful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Impressed by the usefulness of this product , I really like this product and found this useful in too many ways. A good way to watch your kids at home when the come from school. This camera can rotate and provide almost a 360 degree view of kept at the centre of the home. The camera has a good recording capacity and the image quality is good. The night vision is awesome."
135,Amritanshu Tiwari,High internet speed Requirements!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Although its a good product in terms of picture quality considering the price point. But it becomes useless for me because it needs High-speed internet connection for the playback of past recordings, and good internet services are not available in my area as of now that's why I have returned this product. So if you want to purchase this camera first of all check the speed of your internet service provider if it is good then you can buy this camera this is one of the best CCTV cameras I have ever seen especially its pricing is very aggressive."
136,Ajay,Great Camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Excellent performance with nice picture quality. Though I wanted a concealed camera but nothing suitable was available so i bought this. Other than the hidden feature it does an excellent job. Best part is everything can be controlled from an app from anywhere even managing the storage space on SD card.
137,JOYDEEP CHATTERJEE,A must buy if you have kids at home,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Extremely good product with ample functionality.Picture quality is so so and motion detection notification comes with a reasonable lag.Also there is no cloud option where you can store your recorded videos and customer helpdesk is pathetic.
138,Amazon Customer,Inexpensive quality product,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Never imagined that CCTV cam was this much accessible easy to install n use on mobile app. You need to have high speed mobile data or wifi to use it. Very clear live vedio even if you are out of the country. Clear quality night vision.360d rotation when installed upside down. 3 users can access directly.
139,Himanshu,"Best Smart Security Camera, Value for money",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have used multiple security camera's and trust me this is the best security camera. Value for money.Here's my honest feedbackPros:1. Best part is you can talk back, during Covid 19 pandemic it has really helped me to manage my shop. I can simply tell my staff what to do with the live view. It's like a 24X7 Zoom call.2. Night vision mode is amazing3. Offers 1080p picture quality which is really sharp and clear4. Works really well with Alexa and Google assistant5. Best security camera app, very user friendly and has great user experience6. Easy to install, It literally took me 2 mins to setup7. 360 degree rotation works really well, there is no lag as compared to other security camera's8. AI motion detection works really good, it has no lag as compared to other similar camerasOn product page they have How to setup videos and PDF file which is really goodCons:I really don't think this camera has any cons, it does what it claims. I think they should bring some additional features like cloud storage. Hopefully they'll bring it soon as they already have it in China.Overall, This security camera is best in class and is really worth every penny."
140,Sagar B,DO NOT UPDATE THE SOFTWARE IN MI HOME APP,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  One very important thing.DO NOT UPDATE THE CAMERA SOFTWARE VERSION AFTER YOU GET AN UPDATE FIRMWARE MESSAGE. IT WILL BRICK (LOCK) YOUR CAM AND MAKE IT USELESS. The cam gets stuck on orange light and does not respond to even to reset. The only way to unlock the cam will be to download a specific file, put this recovery file in the sd card and then start the cam to unbrick/unlock it.So do not update the cam software."
141,Amazon Customer,Best in class,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very easy to configure and use. Clear picture and sound. The two-way calling feature with voice is awesome.  The rotation feature works very well to scan the room. Mi Home app is quite good and secure. Works well to stream the video even on mobile data. I'm using a 16gb SD card with the camera and and external 16Gb pen drive attached to my router as secondary storage. Works perfectly.Just wish the camera came in black also, but not a big deal."
142,Sunny Unni,Excellent but some compatibility issues with Dlink routers,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Worked perfectly at my home with my ASUS router. Sharp picture Clear audio and very intuitive app. The next day I took it to my office where it was intended to be installed and it just wouldn’t work with my Dlink DLR842 router. So please be careful of this. There are some compatibility issues with Dlink routers. Otherwise it’s a very solid product.
143,hsvijay,awesome product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  wow...MI ,, recently i had purchased this camera its mind blowing device i was wondering the quality and performance this camera perfect camera for security purpose ,,, this camera does all the job accurately without any lagprospicture quality is awesomewe can control the camera sitting anywhereRotate how you wantsupport 64gm ms cardmotion detection is perfectly fineeasy to fixconsnight mode is not so goodotherwise never this camera its must buy product"
144,Dibyendu Mukherjee,High quality Pictures and Recordings.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great product. Great finish. I have purchased a Strontium 64 GB Micro SDXC Card along with Mi 360 Camera. Very high quality pictures. High quality recording in full HD. Blue light on camera indicates that it's in recording mode. It keeps continuous recording till the SDXC Card is full. Thereafter, older videos get erased. Newer videos get recorded.  However for live telecast of recording on your mobile you need 4G connection. Even then, you must keep recording in normal mode in order to receive live video."
145,raju,value for your money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Xiaomi's 360-degree security camera ticks all the right boxes when it comes to an affordable home monitoring solution. The installation needs a bit of work, but aside from that, you're getting a lot of value for your money."
146,sail,Amazing home security camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The equipment is an amazing camera with great Day and Night vision. Its application works fine and is very useful tool to monitor ur home when ur away. It has great recoding features. Great Value gir Money
147,Kunal,Zero for Packaging. Item is OK. Not so amazing.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It doesn't have complete 360 view. If mount this on wall horizontally, it stuck and don't give you complete view. Sound quality while call is very low. People arround the camera doesn't hear voice. They have to come very close to camera if you want to use it's call feature.Zero rating to vendor for packaging. No extra cover or box added to protect the item. I think vendor does not care about how this item shipped to customer."
148,UmapornKhami,Packing seals were broken on delivery. Returned,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Motion detection is somewhat slow. Notification is generated after 4-10 minutes after someone passes through.Night vision is fantastic. I will recommend this product to other customers.2 stars because the package arrived with all seals broken. Must have been returned by some other customer due to some issue.Hence I didn’t want to keep the item returned by some other customer due to some faults.
149,Ganesan,No two way talk,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I found this good in terms of features except two things below1. No two-way talk - The volume from the camera is not audiable and upon searching in google I found this seems to be an open issue and surprisingly I don't see this mentioned anywhere in the review.2. Bandwidth requirement - It needs a high speed dedicated bandwidth on both the side to control. Assume you are out of home and your 4G phone does not have enough speed it is really pathetic to control and see what is happening in the house. Also on the other side if the internet is shared by your other devices the same issue.I am mentioning this because I dont see this on any other's review.
150,Sriram,Awesome product..Really good,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Recently (16.7.2018) i bought this camera even after seeing lot of negative feedback in the reviews but to be frank this is such an awesome product for the money you are paying and it is works more than what i thought it will be .. the camera quality is superb and even in the night mode it works well .. and with audible two way speakers and there are lot of other features also.. I bought this product coz am having one year old son and me and wife won’t be in the home in the day time so i wanted to monitor child as well as my maid too.. now am happy that i can see my child activities from anywhere through Mi home app.. guys pls don’t worry about this product it is really really good ..all you need is good internet connection with a smart phone
151,HK,Nice camera with good Quality.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   Very good product, with great video quality. Its great feature is night vision and 360 degree rotation.Two way audio support is there incase you are out or want to communicate.memory support is there, still figuring out how to connect to electric wiring.Overall nice product, can be configured with more than one mobile, easily accessible from any place.Wifi is needed for this to work but that doesn't seems problem to me."
152,Amazon Customer,Just Awesome superman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome security camera...!! Initial setup is cakewalk... I read some reviews where the mentioned issue with SD card and scanning blaa black... Mine was very easy... Before returning on or connecting power .. insert the sdcard... Scanning just place the code in front of the camera then everything is automatic... Seriously my installation took less than 5 minutesPicture quality is awesome and after enabling WDR , picture become perfect...!! Just started using so not sure about memory usage and all"
153,DEVENDRA VISHWAKARMA,"Good Camera for indoor use, nice picture quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very Good Camera for indoor use, awesome picture quality, and very easy to install. Works well even in low light and dark. Not giving 5 Stars, because of a weird problem: Memory card is slightly out, which is blocking free vertical movement of Camera. Picture attached. Scrapped off few micro meters of SD card, and it is moving freely now. Audio is not that good, but works. Overall, satisfied with product."
154,Aswin,Good camera with very bad night vision,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros: Ease of usage  Cam clarity at day time or night time with lights on.  Covers all the anglesCons: Night vision with out lights you cant see anything at all.  Doesnt give notifications for all the motion detections. Only gives notifications only some movements.
155,Atanu,not a PTZ camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Image quality is fine. Shape and build quality is good...BUTPan, tilt but no zoom..And the proprietary system to latch the camera to the base is completely unnessary. That should have been a plain and simple socket for 1/4"" screw."
156,Abin,"For indoor applications, Highly recommended",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This wireless camera is good, not that much amazing. The only thing you should consider while buying this camera is the Network strength. Without proper internet, you cannot even change the surveillance camera angle, video will not be clear and motion detection will not work. The body quality is medium and i think it cannot survive harsh environments. Indoor application is the apt purpose for this camera."
157,Himanshu Patil,Very nice camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am writing this review after 3 weeks of using it. Very happy with my purchase. I inserted a 64gb micro SD card to record all day everyday. 64gb is able to store abt a week's recording and it automatically deletes old recordings to make space for new recording. Night vision works fine. Haven't tried motion detecter since I use it at home. Picture quality is very clear. Ur able to watch live camera even when ur at work as long as both the location has net access. U can also watch recorded footage when ur away from home. No regrets buying this camera, it was money well spent."
158,Archie,Great product - well worth the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,  An absolute life saver and so worth the money. We bought this when our Motorola camera broke during our vacation in India and we were pleasantly surprise how much better this camera was compared to Motorola and that too for a fraction of the price!We love that we can install the app in multiple devices and have no distance limitation to monitor the cam on a device. Only thing you need is good Wifi connectivity.. we have been using it for over 6 months now and absolutely love it.
159,Kiran,Worth the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  All features are excellent. I have mounted it perpendicular to the wall instead of handing from the ceiling but still works perfectly.Only problem is it does not always send motion alert on time. Also cloud storage support would have been a good feature.
160,MANU,It's a good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after first day.1. Working is easy2. Best for homes3. It's not battery supported, so it's working only in electricity or power bank4. Easy installation5. Camera quality is average, but not bad6. Night vision is good7. Live telecasting is fine8. Connect another wifi in device, it's make waste time and it's some difficult.9. Motion sensor is average10. Call feature is good, but sound quality very poor.11. Design just ok12. Color is okTotal rating 4/5"
161,AMIT MEHTA,Good product but sometimes not record,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good product but there is some problem which has to be resolve. I had given proper power and also attached a power backup if power has gone camera can shot continuously but when the main power has gone it stops working whereas powerbank already attached between camera and main power.So please resolve this problem and update the product also so that it can shot Smoothly unless this product become useless if it not shot continuously.

163,Abhishek Kaushik,Not compatible with any NVR,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is good, but if you looking for connecting it with NVR (network video recorder) , it's not workable. No user manual. I tried connecting with hikvision NVR, with multiple modes, nothing worked. Sricam and srihome ip cameras worked great. Returned these and got srihome / sricam ip cams instead."
164,Manish,Camera Review,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is no way to operate this camera over LAN(Intranet), So it has trade off between privacy and comfort. This camera has amazing features and fully operational via its android client application, but its hangs very frequently while video streaming specially if you are operating(moving) the camera while watching, So if you are more concerned about real time video, it will not serve the purpose. No way to view its streaming outside its mobile application(Over laptop etc), no way to connect it to any other streaming server(camera is not configurable for streaming setting at all) ."
165,VENKATESH,Home security camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The best CCTV camera I’ve ever used in this price range.Cam quality is amazing on both day and night vision.Cam comes with wide angle lens. The two way speaker comes handy if u r using it as a monitor.
166,suganya,Good Product but always need internet,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall Its a good product. Working as expected.1. If you have internet then this is a good choice to go.2. If you are expecting only Memory card storage then don't go for this option.3. Jiofi can be used to transfer the video.(Wifi modem/Broadband anything). Some source of internet is required to transfer the data4. We can monitor the video from anywhere in the world if we have internet5. The sound quality also good6. Configuration also easy and easy to install. Just follow the video.7. Now I have configured in two mobile phones. Without any issues I can monitor it
167,Joseph Paul Panikulam,Awesome security camera at a very reasonable price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really awesome product, could connect it with jiofi and also possible to connect using wifi hotspot of another 4G enabled phone close to the vicinity, the picture quality is excellent, also settings in the app gives various options, including updating the OS,  highly recommended, go for it."

169,JIMEET,Excellent camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's an excellent camera. I m using it purely for viewing purpose and not using for recording and it's working flawless!If the camera is mounted on ceiling inverted, initially the live view is shown inverted in the app. To rotate that live view, go to camera settings - image settings - rotate the captured image and save it. Your camera will show rotated view in the live view in the app."
170,Amazon Customer,Good product for indoor surveillance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got it to monitor my home when I was away. It works pretty well and does its job. It detects motions to the extent that it an insect flies within its range, it can detect it. It has the ability to detect between human motion and regular motion (such as fan). The night vision is pretty good. Over all I am satisfied"
171,Shambhu Varma,Nice product needs refinement,5.0 out of 5 stars,  1. Picks up every tiny subjects. Can’t it avoid sensing pets and small insects.2. There should have been provision to switch off sound by the owner if he does not wants the sound  to be shared.3. Wish it was possible to store recordings in iCloud.
172,Kannan,NAS storage not working via dongle wifi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  If the power supply stops, you need to connect the device with wifi everytime in order to start recording.Easy to installNo option for cloud storage and it's not connecting to NAS storage via dongle wifi. (i.e. unable to connect to MicroSD inside dongle)"
173,Sainadh,You just got to stay away from this crap,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Motion detection is worst and night vision is better on YI camera. I’m disappointed by this camera. I should i have stick with YI it selfReview after 4 months:Absolute piece of garbage. It wont record sometimes and it wont detect sometimes. It will send u alert after half hour or so.What is point of being this called a security camera lol. We missed a crucial footage that was needed and this stupid thing didn’t record it.
174,Deepak Srinivasan,Good.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Night Vision quality is not up to the mark!! But it does it job!! Day light condition picture Quality is WOOW! Motion Detection is not accurate or on time push notification. Lack of cloud storage! Talk back feature is pretty good!! Had some issues while setting up!! QR code dosent scanned!! It does only after 8-9 attempts. But it is easy. Must buy product!! It does it’s job pretty good.
175,Vivek Kumar,Reasons to not buying it,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Waste of money, bcoz it works only with High speed of internet.It is mentioned that it work with WiFi hotspot..but it is wrong. All thing mentioned is false. I have connected with Jio WiFi.It always show's. Connecting connecting.such anwaste products. Waste of money."
176,Shri,Good Product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best IP camera in such low price. Setting was easy but sharing your camera with other person is time consuming. But overall very good product, sometime becomes offline eventhough there is WiFi connectivity"
177,Mohit Mittal,A Good Product with minor bugs,4.0 out of 5 stars,  video quality of camera is great as compared to other cameras in same category. facing some issue with talkback. echo happens always when I use the talkback function. some times notifications come with some delay in automation mode.
178,Jitender Singh,Very nice product by mi.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Its easy our life now i am able to monitor by child where she goes. Thanks mi for such products. Please sell some more home security products in india also. I ordered one more after six month to see nice experience with device. Now i can able to see both camera on my phone at same time even my wife also see on similar time. Thanks Mi.
179,Manal S.,"Over all good, need software changes",4.0 out of 5 stars,  MI should provide cloud data saving option along with single screen view of multiple cameras
180,Greg,Works as Advertised,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Works well as home camera. Decent features and app. There are a few bugs they need to sort out, especially related to motion detection.. I got motion detection alerts (even with lower threshold set), whenever there is a switch from regular vision to night vision. But these are things you can manually review and judge."
181,Akif Ahmad,Best Camera for Home Security  |  Great and Powerful Performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In one word ... simply awesome product by MI ... its a flawless and best quality 1080 P picture quality and backup and detect every small and sensitive motion as well like if any fly and mosquito cross the camera they are able to detect the motion and capture... this was very impressive features and I am using back 1 month and no complains yet.
182,Bibliognost,Got a used product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have no issues with the product, it is good. The problem is that I have been sent a USED product. Totally worn out and perhaps a broken part inside, when you shake you can feel that. Worse, the packet and the invoice says it is a gift from Manish Gupta, I wish it were a gift. Perhaps someone used the product with all brutality and then returned it. Even the base has pencil marks of the direction where to screw it on the wall. To cut it short, I paid for new and got a used product. I’m buying another one because it is a good product, I hope this time I get a new one and not a used one."
183,adarsh,A very good yet affordable IP camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's best in IP camera category. I have been using these cameras for more than 4 months and they are truly working upto more than my expectations. With each iteration of software update the cameras are getting better. I think the best thing is all about MI app which is very easy and efficient.  The configuration or camera set up was easy. I am using one non MI camera as well and understood that no body is close to MI cameras. What more I expect is MI should add a battery backup camera and an outdoor camera as well  to their IP camera line up.
184,Hary,No more Chinese owned Products.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Being an Indian,  I don't wish to buy any more Chinese owned Products. If you are an Indian..or true HUman never buy any Chinese owned products...more Desi...products...only Indian."

186,Bhushan,Best budget CCTV camera on Amazon.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is the best budget camera on Amazon. Delivery was so fast. Installation and setup is very quick. Best thing is usb cable provided is long enough to reach power source. Just ensure good WiFi network for speedy motion detection alrets.
187,Devesh,Good camera but without the most important feature of a 360 degree CCTV camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera is very good. picture quality, motion detection, night mode is very good.The camera only fails in the most important department. You expect from a 360 camera that it can have an automatic travel option where you can set it to monitor 360 degrees. But alas in this camera you can set it only manually everytime.FAIL!!"
188,Abhilash Joseph C,Won't connect to NAS.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  We have only option to backup saved video is NAS. Unfortunately that functionality won't work. I use WD NAS drive. I try all possible option . Did not work. It shows "" location not found "" ."
189,Ashish Bhargava,Amazing product... Go for it...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have bought this product from Amazon and found it to be most satisfying product.I first bought one piece just to try it out after going through its reviews in here but after trying it and on the basis of first hand experience, I ordered 2 more pieces. Picture quality is perfect. You can talk on the other side through its calling system. Its night vision is also good. It's just that it is in black and white but very clear. I will recommend to go for this product."
190,DD,Nice camera but motion detection is not very consistent,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  if you need a camera that can record in every light condition its good, but if you need motion detection it may not give accurate results always.Installation is easy and length of charging cord is good 2 mtr. You may need to setup a power source as it has to be connected via a charger hence internal wiring may not be possible"
191,Sathyashankara Bhat,Very basic security camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Every time I connect to the camera using my phone it keeps doing initialisation and takes quite some time to finish it before you actually look at camera data. Night vision is averageand motion detect is dumb as even a leaf shakes it captured videos.
192,Amazon Customer,It goes offline in 4 to 5 days,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought it on 3rd Oct. Installed and went away for few days. I saw it went offline when I was away. When I came I checked and found that it's not getting power. I removed the USB charging cable and inserted then it started working. Now it's repeating every 4 to 5 days. Is it  cable problem or  adopter problem or camera problem? It started frustrating me.
193,Dinesh Kumar Acharya,Everything is fine but missing auto focus with rotation,4.0 out of 5 stars,  First time I purchased this from MI. Thought of best deal. No doubt it's a good 360 degree camera.The app did jog come with auto focus feature. While many  cameras provide same feature.. The camera rotates and detects the object. It's missing.
194,Asif,MI cam 360,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I recieved the cctv cam on right time. it is very easy to install and instructions are given in the pamphlet... it is very good cam for indoor and i will say it is value for money...  i can see my family even i am away from them and i can have verbal conversation with them.
195,Ashish Singh,Issues with live streaming,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This camera always hanging, lagging issues while watching live on mobile. Video stucks always after 1-2 minutes of live streaming & shows a message ""establishing the connection"". Whenever on the  same network i'm using another brand camera which has never lagging issues."
196,Amazon Customer,Excellent product,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It took me 5 mins to configure this product.Picture quality is awesome even at 720p and HD is of course better.Voice quality can be improved as the speaker is not a very good frequency responder.I will suggest to buy this product and attach a backup power supply.
197,Aj,Not supporting 64 GB card otherwise perfect camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Installation is easy and done within 5 min of unpacking (if followed as per manual)Picture quality perfect for wireless cameraCamera head rotation goodNo significant delay in image displayMemory card support: they said it will support 64 gb- but it is not recognising my newly purchased Samsung 64 GB card v10
198,Bhaskar,Good not great,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Yeah it's gud not that efficient but doing great with it's featuring..only power supply not battery supported but u can manage it with power banks to continues supply.. connecting to network is easy but shifting to another wifi u need to remove the device in mi home app account and add it by connecting another wifi u wanted all again..no auto rotation mode of 360° u can only control it app when u live stream it only..and camera viewing and night vision clarity is outstanding...motion detection is good alarming is gud..microphone has a little flaw I think it's not capturing every little sound in sorroundings and the speaker has a very low sound ..and managing sd card is great..all u need to do is set the position which u wanted to see the place..and overall this one is not that great but it's good to have ...my suggestion if have a old smartphone download the Alfred app and log it with Google account on both devices u can easily view from anywhere and it's fantastic than this

204,Jeet,The best home Cam in a budget!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great product. I am very happy with the purchase, I have been using this product for 4months now, and it is working fine. Had my reservations in the beginning, having never used an mi product before, but am overall satisfied. I really like the feature to speak and listen in real time via the camera.If I had to knit pick, I would say that the maximum storage limit of 64gb is a bit less for 1080p resolution videos and should be increased."
205,buyer,"Not bad, value for money,",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Vertical movement could be increased to make it 360°, else its 180°, Storage could be 128g, 64gb is too less for Hd recording. installati9n mode also should have option to install at right angle apart from roof mounted and table top."
206,Mentor,Not really 360°,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This 360 ° CCTV camera does not cover the complete 360° area. I had hanged it exactly upside down but it is unable to cover the area just under the camera. Can seeany restrictions for it's rotation.

217,Saravanan,Why internet connection is required to start recording in memory card,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am quite unhappy to know that internet connection is required to start video recording in memory card. Initial setup requiring internet connection is understandable, but internet connection for every restart (due to power cut) is not acceptable. If there is a solution to this bug, I will be more happy about the product. Not a recommended product for people who wants automatic start of recording in memory card without connection to internet."

241,mohit jain,Highly recommended,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It is highly highly recommended since a CCTV camera at Rs2600 can help you tremendously whenever any untoward incident takes place. The best part is no wiring hassles. Just plug and play. Due to this you can also shift the location if needed in future anywhere if you feel so. No big hardisk or separate TV needed to operateMany a times we fail to provide evidence whenever a crime or burglary takes place. Hence blindly go for it.
242,Kapil singh,Great Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is great . Apart from all the things that have been mentioned . I placed the camera behind the window facing outside , so the camera gets blinded from the reflection of the Infrared rays from the window , rendering the night vision useless in my case .

Internet  should be required  only when someone  watching it from other place in the world. I am surprised that how mi expert team could not understand this basic process.Now I suggest only that mi should give a quick solution of this problem before mi customers have to purchase other camera for their home security.

3881,Rishi M,Good product with a small issue,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  All good and works as advertised except for a small glitch. It can't switch to IR Mode automatically when woken up from sleep. The IR switch mode works perfectly if the Camera is not put to sleep. So, if you had your lights on when you put it to sleep mode, it will show a black screen when it wakes up. The only option then to restore the function is to restart it by switching off its power."
3882,Customer,Difficulty in setup..,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I was not verge of returning the product due to installation issues and later had to sleep over it to come over solutions.1. Product didn't read the QR code from mobile. Had to print screen the QR code to desktop and then only it read the QR code.2. Tried different servers and India recommended and India (Asia only) both worked. you need to give it some time for the camera to show up on the mi home screen. Don't know why.3. Works with Jio dongle. (I had a doubt on this)
3883,Niladri,Absolutely the WORST interface ever for a Spy Camera.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is one of those devices that betray the very reason of purchase in the first place. While daylight picture quality is decent (not so much the night), the most painful experience is with the tin can of an app that this device comes with - Mi Home. Over 90% of the time it will never let you connect to the device from your phone to view live footage (see attached pic - It always gets stuck at Initializing even with the most stable of Wifi & Internet connections), and even when it does the interface is so slow, you might sometimes give up. That being said, it does give decent usability for the remaining 10% of the time, if that makes any sense."
3884,Amazon Customer,Good security camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Excellent security camera. Wish there was an option for cloud storage
3885,Suhas Donti,The best budget security camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent security camera, far far better than other brands like dlink. Worth for the every penny spent on this. Expecting Mi to launch more products!!"
3886,Falconite Interior,"MI orginal product, exceeded my expectations",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Never had a second thought when the brand is MI while purchasing, and I am been enjoying this product to the fullest.... Over exceeded my expectations 😊😊👍About Amazon also exceeded my expectations as the stock was not available, but there got me this product within 1 hour of requesting..."
3887,JJ,Worth for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This camera is very useful.using this we veiw  all angles and commanding through phone by speaker in camera might sound not hearing well but it very usefulConnecting with mihome also very easyTotally I by 8 camera all are wellBut small doubt how long it will work in good condition 😀😀
3888,Amazon Customer,Awesome... But where's SD slot?? Difficult to setup??,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have seen lot of reviews saying there is no SD slot, it is there you need to slide the front camera from bottom to top (See attached pic). Also some reviews mention that it's difficult to setup, however there are several YouTube videos available which can make your life easier.Pros:* HD quality video and photos* Sends short videos to your phone whenever it detects motion in coverage area, without requiring a SD card.* Very nice clarity at night time.* Allows you to share live feed with others using MI account.* Allows you to record live video using app.* Allows 2-way voice call which is cool.* Can be restarted remotely using app.* Allows you to set monitoring time (Like only night time, if you want to save on wifi usage)* Allows you to change alert sensitivity from high to low so that it doesn't detect every small movement, but only large movements.* Allows you to move the camera around remotely using the app.Cons:* Requires continuous power supply, so you need to have it connected to your inverter if you have frequent power cuts.* Need SD card if you want continuous recording.* Customer care doesn't know about all features of this product and what's available in app settings.* Doesn't automatically move if a person is moving to capture the movement, stays stationary in one position. You can however move it manually using app."
3889,Manoj kiran,worst worst worst worst Don't Believe Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   XIAOMI is good brand.But I did not except this product from them.It worked for 2 months, And then it talks in chinese language.not connecting to wifi, don't know how to rectify the problem.suffered a lot.Very much Inconvinence created by the AMAZON. SO iam planning to not buy anything Amazon From Now.Fedup with the Product and Amazon.Most irritated product then i spent nearly 1000 rupees to go to Service center.They Don't Know about the product.They sent me to other Town service center then I went there. I waited for 4 hours.The Reponse from is very bad.With great Effort and Debate, Discussion like parliament. I got my product replaced.But I will never believe this Amazon and Xiaomi.I think Flipkart is best than Amazonworst service by XiaomiWorst Product delivered by AmazonIam ready to take Action on this issue"
3890,Shaik Anwar Younus,Excellent choice for home security,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent security camera, far far better than other brands like dlink. Worth for the every penny spent on this. Expecting Mi to launch more products!!*** I am very happy with this product."
3891,Rishabhh Chouhan,It's Fab...but sry I don't buy it from Amazon...I will import it😎,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It consumes around 10gb of storage in 24hours in 'HD' mode.Pros :Night mode recording.Clarity of camera.Multiple users can watch camera recording at same time.Two way communication.1080p HD recording.Can record videos without internet , requires internet connection after switching camera on - after that you can disconnect & recording will continue.ICons:It doesn't support AUTO 360° rotation. User has to manually adjust camera from application.If there is a power outage or by any chance you disconnect power source , camera would start recording again after you connect it to internet.You need to keep camera connected to a power source for 24hours - charging option would've been helpful here.Application sometimes sends motion alerts after delay of 30minutes(approx).Memory card of storage capacity greater than 64gb are not supported."
3892,VGo,"Not working with Google home, better alternate from Xiaomi and other are available",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera is good, I've been using it since a year and it has never been switched off, still works!Which I didn't expect. Good.Recently also tested the motion sensor feature which has been improved a lot.It's slow, moving it via app takes some patience, it's not as smooth and effortless as I wanted it to be. But for a smart camera this cost, it's good.Reason I gave a 3 star rating is that it doesn't work with Google Home. Most cameras claiming to be smart cameras do actually work with home and Alexa. Not working with ifttt, Google Home.Recently another xiaomi camera is being supported by Google home, it is lower in cost so I would rather go with that next time so that I can see it on a larger screen using voice commands.Update: The cheaper camera from Xiaomi is better in connectivity, and works with Google home.Also many cameras cheaper than this are now available which will work.You have to use Hong Kong or Singapore server cameras, the basic camera with no rotation will work with Google home, the new version not YI version. I would really not recommend this camera as of now. I hope support for Google Home will be added soon."
3893,JOAN,QR code note reading by the device camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not reading QR code for pairing
3894,Srinivasan V,Not able to save videos in mobile,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased Mi 360 from Mi website in May 2019. So far it works fine. I could view the video even far away from my city. Everything ok. But the main draw backs are:1. It not possible to save videos in the mobile. There is Save provision in Mi App. But this stores only in SD card of the camera, not in mobile storage. This is a serious draw back. If someone steals the camera, then  everything lost.  I do not know NAS and cloud. Probably it is required to pay monthly charges for this facility.I am using 64 GB memory card and record only movements. So it records upto 10 days. There is looping provision.Mi should find ways of storing critical videos in the mobile. Then it will be the best piece."
3895,Dipen Sen,Limited functionality | No desktop/web monitoring available (Only android phone),2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This camera is useless if you plan to have multiple camera at your home and you want to keep a browser/desktop app open all time while working at workplace. This camera is only supported by mobile app. From mobile app you can not rotate camera if you are using multiple view. And keeping app open drains your battery. Until Xiaomi supports web/desktop app, its useless. I wasted my money behind it and had to get other IP cameras which is serving the purpose way better."
3896,Shankara   A,Good but not equivalent to CCTV systems,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Mi Home Security Camera 360° has a clean and attractive design, and looks almost like a toy, The main camera body is a spherical shell with a pill-shaped cutout that allows the camera lens to tilt up and down. There's also a microSD card slot below the lens. On the back of the spherical body is the circular speaker grill.  The whole device appears to be made out of sturdy polycarbonate. The solid build quality certainly serves as an assurance of longevity. videos, picture quality it captures is surprisingly good, especially when compared to what similarly priced offerings from other companies deliver. In well-lit environments, be it indoors or outdoors,The biggest strength of the Mi Home Security Camera 360° is its ability to record videos even in darkness. The device comes equipped with eight 940nm infrared LEDs that allow it to record video even when it is pitch dark. The footage we captured in such scenarios were decently sharp and detailed, and although they are monochrome, there is very little grainy texture.The camera can automatically switch between night vision and daytime modes when needed. The night vision mode works best at a range of 8-10m.Even at night, the camera was able to capture the movement  of a small insect hovering near it, and sent an alert.The camera has a sleep mode that lets users shut it down without having to disconnect it.You can activate sleep mode manually with the tap of a button or by setting up a custom schedule. When you wake the device from sleep, it takes a few seconds to recalibrate itself and begin transmitting the live feed.If you want a good indoor smart camera then it is a good option, this camera is not nearly equivalent to a CCTV systems I own both the system's.  this camera sometime works sometimes not. You can install 4 camera + DVR+ 2 tb Hard drive with in 15k to 18k with good amount of storage space and all the features in this camera expect 360° viewing and audio trackback features.If you want a single camera, little tech-savvy then it is a good buy. Other wise go for Normal CCTV systems of any good brand like hikvision,cpplus. etc"
3897,Anil Surya,Product at its best for money spent,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this from MI site and delivery was super fast, I received it within 24hrs of placing the order. Now coming to setup and performance, I feel that it is replacement for many home security camera in market although there are some cons but every product has that. Setting up was super easy and camera detection from app is simple and detect immediately and after that even if it is switched off and back again it will connect automatically to network. I have UPs and NAS storage device in my network so I'm able to backup without any issues. At full HD clarity it can store upto 7 days and deletes old videos and in NAS storage it will store upto 3 months which is fine for home purpose. If you want simple home security setup then go for it.Only con I found is, motion detection alert, sometimes it send alerts immediately and sometimes after sometime other than that I did not find any issues."
3898,P S ROY,Helpful device.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This device is overall showing satisfactory performance since the time of purchase (about 6months). I must admit...I am really impressed by its night time visual clarity.We have had lot of security issues at our apartment. ..so we installed at the ceiling of our entrance gate...the 64 GB memory card is quite helpful to playback previous recorded visuals. However, people with Microsoft devices be kindly beware as this device and it's app is not compatible with it.Unless you have a WiFi connection within range of this device...it is not possible to install and activate this device. Also plz be clear that installation is completely owners headache...company guys smartly wash their hands out. Apart from this , it is quite a helpful home security device."
3899,Sank,"Feature,",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a perfect security camera if you're mainly looking for one that you can monitor wirelessly from anywhere in the world. Once you set up this camera with your mobile, you can view it live from anywhere in the world. Your camera will need to be connected to WiFi and your phone will need data/WiFi in order for you to watch Live from anywhere. But incase that's a problem, you can also insert a memory card in the camera which will record throughout the day or when it detects motion, as per the settings you put. This camera is just excellent. The night vision is perfect. Motion detection is amazing , detects even small flies. Brilliant is one word to sum it up. Go for it."
3900,Adarsh,Problems with Storage and App access.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was excited about this until I installed this and observed for more than a day. I noticed that every time i open the app, it shows buffering and doesn't show camera footage. Only when I restart the camera can I view it properly . (2) For some reason , the camera doesn't store videos on the SD card. It only stored videos from Day 1 (3) Home monitoring: if I switch on motion based recording , it records video only for like 10 seconds after a motion is detected. Example: Some came to clean the room, detection started but ended in 10 secs while the person was still cleaning the room after ."
3901,Sp,Great product by xiaomi.. Worth buying.!.!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Night vision is pretty good.. Motion detection feature is great and picture quality is also best but depends on your Internet speed when you are viewing from remote place.  Overall a worth buying product and value for money in this price range.  Some may experience a bit difficulty in connecting the device to the network but in the end its your Internet speed that does matter here. If good Internet speed then you'll experience no connectivity issue at all.  It will be a smooth connectivity.  I do recommend this product if you are looking for a best ip camera in this price range 2-3k. Bought 2 more xiomi ip cameras for my house. The one which I had bought earlier is working pretty well so thought of getting two more cameras cameras for home Security. Overall very nice product by xiomi. 👍
3902,Janak Shah,Amazing Camera and Value of money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is perfect camera with a complete package of expectation.Pros :- Live viewing on mobile- Motion detection and notification- Night vision- Internal storage upto 64GB MSDC,- Remotely controlled camera angle ( 360""),- one can control memory card content via mobile.cons :when you switch to other wifi connection for camera, you have reset all camera settings. There is no option to switch Camera's Wifi settings. You can have different wifi for your mobile but one need to configure camera if wifi changes."
3903,Prakash Soni,"Avoid buying, All xiamo Mi products are not good",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good thing for two star camera1. Easy to install2. Connection with mi360 camera is faster than any other camera available in the market.3. Recordjng easy to browse minutes by minutes.Bad things1. Stop working at night as soon as night vision start and doesn't resume at night. So, I have to stop camera to get infrared on. NO NIGHT VISION for my camera. I contacted service centre they believe in replacement but not in refund. Same thing continued with new one and finally I learnt that you cankeep either camera upside down or infrared on.2. You cannot download video directly to your phone or computer from storage. You have to take out micro card and copy paste."
3904,Amazon Customer,Mi fanboys are giving this product a high rating. The might not have used other companies products.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Except for MI fanboys, this won't be a value for money purchase. I'll start with the cons -1. The app is real slow. Whenever trying to connect with the camera it takes time (compared to other similar ip camers like D3D, ProElite or SriCam - these are definitely better)2. If you ought to use this for motion detection, it  comes out very delayed. Sometimes motion detection alarm notification comes out after hours.3. App looks good, but is not simple or can't use it as fast as we use with some other basic camera apps.I've been using SriCam and D3D for my two offices. Bought this for my home. Extremely disappointed.Pros -1. Build quality is good.2. Looks good.Mi fanboys are giving this product a high rating. The might not have used other companies products."
3905,Kira3366,Mi home camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Hopeless product
3906,Suhas Bharadwaj,Suddenly switched off just after 6 months,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't go for this product. Please note this product has only 6 months Warranty period.  Typical chinese product with low quality.As long it works it is fine.  I used it for near 6 months.  But around 185 days it failed to power on. I took it to MI service center in Jayanagar, 3rd Block, Bangalore.  They checked and said it is out of warranty and cannot be repaired or replaced.Even they sent an email to their support team and answer has been No.  So be very careful."

3909,Kapil,"Bad camera quality, Fake motion recordings(ucchi dukaan, feeka pakwaan)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. camera qualit is standard.2. Camera motion based recording is not working properly. even if curtain move due to air, its maling recording. while they claimed its AI based motion detection to avoid fake alert.3. Video recording file is only for 1 mintue. No option to choose different size file size. Means for 1 hours video recording we will get 60 files.4. Motion detection sensitivity is poor. It will detect the motion only if motion is continious for 5+ seconds. In between of 5 seconds, if some one stol camera, this event will not track.5. No cloud storage option6. NAS storage is copy paste between sd card and nas storage.7. After restart camera, camera angle change automatically. Maximum chinese product have same issue.I will to get refund my money.5."
3910,Tanuj Talwar,A must buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I read the reviews here an bought it directly from the Mi store to avoid getting any fake product. It’s been one of the best buys. Works silently and without issues.- Motion detection works perfectly even if a fly moves by- Image quality is superb even during night vision- My ceiling is white and I’ve installed it inverted so it’s pretty unnoticeable- Mobile app works very well and is very intuitiveOverall it’s been an excellent experience
3911,Prime Member,DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT INTERNET,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this from Mi.com and just confirmed with the customer care. Even if you are at home, on the same Wifi as the camera, you cannot connect to it unless you have an active internet connection."
3912,Amazon Customer,Pathetic nigth vision,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nigth vision is pathetic, I want to challenge MI on this i have tested it so many times today but it doesnt detect a purly standing person in front of the cameraAdditionally there is only one clip to stand the camera which if breakes onlygod knows how to  station the cameraPlease return the money and take it back"
3913,Sai vijaya bhaskar g,"Dont BUY,if u have requirements like watching live on TV , multiple videos switching at a time",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Night vision extremely good. It support only mobile. It does not support MI tv. We cannot monitor continuously. Zooming quality very bad. Motion alerting has fixed interval. So in between fixed interval any motion cannot be saved.  Finally not a good option to buy , if u want continous monitor on TV"

Even when i was ready to pay the expanses whatever it was .....even then they denied.... when i talked to the company they always reply fixed lines ""THIS IS COMPANY POLICY WE CAN NOT DO ANYTHING "" ....THIS CAMERA IS REPLACEABLE IN WARRANTY AND  NOT REPAIRABLE AFTER WARRANTY .... then why i should waste my valuable money to the chines product for which they can not provide any support or services even after customer is ready to pay the  money  whatever it"
3915,Sahil,A Must Buy!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Absolutely amazing product! Xiaomi's Security camera is really amazing, night vision is also best I have seen and home monitoring functionality is so cool!

3917,CHANDRA BHOOSHAN GUPTA,Best wifi camera for indoor security purposes.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is very good and it is worthy. Its Picture quality is much better than others. It records video in offline mode also. Night vision is best.My only one suggestion is that if you have purchased it and updating its firmware then do not get it to be interrupted. If you did this then your camera will be dead as I faced once and for maintenance of this issue you have to go its service center where your camera will be healthy i.e., in original condition."

3919,Mahima Jain,Speaker is worst,3.0 out of 5 stars,  i bought this Mi 360 camera just today.. am sorry to say that its  speaker quality is very very bad.. you will not be able to hear anything even after keeping it near to your ear..Its the only negative thing in it..Rest all is very good..If any one could manage it without speaker then go for it else dont go for it. .
3920,pradeep s.,"Worth the money, perfect for home use",5.0 out of 5 stars,  Targeted for home use and it perfectly does the. Motion detection and the notification sent to your phone solves most of the home needs... Do not consider this for commercial purpose and if you want to record continously.... Also at times initial setup may be little bit challenging
3921,Saurav,Not working anymore with fixed yellow light problem,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  My camera was offline for a couple of months, and when I tried to reconnect, there is no response with a fixed yellow light. MI provides no support, and the firmware repair through sd card is a hit or miss. Within one year (warranty just 6 months), the product went kaputt and I wont be able to trust a Xiaomi Camera again unless they provide a resolution"

3923,Mohit,"Great camera , pathetic software.",4.0 out of 5 stars,  While everything about camera is great. Mi home application is just pathetic. I receive notification for the movement after 3 to 4 hours past the movement time. App crashes very often. And the most funny part is that mi application functions perfectly on ios. And one would think mi would have made android application batter. Software was and will be always Achilles hill for mi hardware and mobiles.
3924,PRANIT,Excellent camera and idea.. needs better tech support...,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera is superb in terms of vision and can be controlled even when away... however the app is very slow in downloading the detection videos... App needs to be updated... support not good...

4208,Amazon Customer,Overall good but not best,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't be misled by inaccurate and wrong description that camera records footage in SSD card even when it's offline* , it's does but conditions apply. You need to connect camera to internet to start recording, if you disconnect internet it would keep on recording in ssd card provided there is no electricity disconnection. But in case electricity supply is disconnected and electricity supply resumes then it needs internet to start recording even in SSD card or if there is no internet connection it would not record footage. Moral of the story is you need internet connection whenever camera is switched on at least for 1 minute then then only it would start recording in SSD card, after 1 minute you can disconnect internet and it would keep on recording in ssd card. Bought it, ran from pillar to post ,even Redmi customer care and service center people confused about it's functioning, then came to know about it's catch.HOPE IT HELPS PROSPECTIVE BUYERS."
